A member of the  Democratic Party, he was the first  African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a  U.S. senator from  Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an  Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\n Obama was born in  Honolulu,  Hawaii. After graduating from  Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in  Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in  Harvard Law School, where he was the first black person to head the   Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the  University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he  represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the  Illinois Senate, when he  ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July  Democratic National Convention  keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after  his presidential campaign began, and after  close primary campaigns against  Hillary Clinton. Obama was  elected over  Republican  John McCain and was  inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n Regarded as a  centrist  New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the  Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the  Budget Control and the  American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in  Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia  New START treaty, and  ended military involvement in the  Iraq War. He ordered  military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of  Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in  the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni  Al-Qaeda operative  Anwar al-Awlaki.\n After winning  re-election by defeating Republican opponent  Mitt Romney, Obama was  sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for  LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to strike down  same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (  United States v. Windsor and   Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was  legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in   Obergefell. He advocated for  gun control in response to the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on  assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning  global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered  military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by  ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of  ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015  Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated  sanctions against Russia following the  invasion in Ukraine and again after  Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a  nuclear deal with Iran, and  normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated  three justices to the Supreme Court:  Sonia Sotomayor and  Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while  Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan  obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's  soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.  [2]\n Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among  the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in  Washington, D.C.  [3]  [4] A December 2019  Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.

[7]  [8]  [9] He is the only president born outside the  contiguous 48 states.  [10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother,  Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in  Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,  [11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.  [12] His father,  Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),  [13] was a married  [14]  [15]  [16]  Luo Kenyan from  Nyang'oma Kogelo.  [14]  [17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language class at the  University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.  [18]  [19] The couple married in  Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.  [20]  [21]\n In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the  University of Washington in  Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in  economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at  Harvard University, where he earned an  M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.  [22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.  [23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,  [24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.  [25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"  [19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.  [26]\n\n         Obama (right) with  his father in  Hawaii, 1971\n In 1963, Dunham met  Lolo Soetoro at the  University of Hawaii; he was an  Indonesian  East–West Center  graduate student in  geography. The couple married on  Molokai on March 15, 1965.  [27] After two one-year extensions of his  J-1 visa, Lolo returned to  Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the  Tebet sub district of  south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the  Menteng sub district of  central Jakarta.  [28]\n\n  Education  [ edit ]\n Obama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local  Indonesian-language schools:  Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and   Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language  Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.  [29]  [30] As a result of those four years in  Jakarta, he was able to speak  Indonesian fluently as a child.  [31]  [32]  [33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"  [34]\n In 1971, Obama returned to  Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn and  Stanley Dunham. He attended  Punahou School—a private  college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.  [35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"  [36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,  Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in  anthropology at the  University of Hawaii.  [37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at  Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.  [38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a  PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for  ovarian and  uterine cancer.  [39]\n Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"  [40] Obama has also written and talked about using  alcohol,  marijuana, and  cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"  [41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  [42]  [43]\n After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to  Los Angeles to attend  Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the  disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of  apartheid.  [44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in  Pakistan and  India for three weeks.  [44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to  Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in  political science with a specialty in  international relations  [45] and in  English literature  [46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.  [47] He graduated with a  BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the  Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,  [48]  [49] then as a project coordinator for the  New York Public Interest Research Group on the  City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.  [50]  [51]  [52]\n\n  Family and personal life  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Family of Barack Obama\n         Obama poses in the  Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009.\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of  his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher.\"  [53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living.  [54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,  Madelyn Dunham,  [55] until her death on November 2, 2008,  [56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in  Moneygall in May 2011.  [57] In  Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis,  President of the Confederate States of America during the  American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with  George W. Bush and  Dick Cheney, among others.  [58]  [59]  [60]\n\n         Obama with  Jonathan Toews and the  Stanley Cup champion  Chicago Blackhawks, 2010\n Obama is a supporter of the  Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the  2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.  [61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the  All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.  [62] He is also primarily a  Chicago Bears football fan in the  NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a  fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in  Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.  [63] In 2011, Obama invited the  1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their  Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the  Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  [64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,  [65] and he is left-handed.  [66]\n\n         Obama takes a left-handed  jump shot during a  pickup game on the  White House basketball court, 2009.\n Obama lived with anthropologist  Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.  [67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.  [67]  [68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  [68]\n In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin.  [69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.  [70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.  [71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent  in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.  [72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,  [73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.  [74] The Obama daughters attended the  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the  Sidwell Friends School.  [75] The Obamas have two  Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named  Bo, was a gift from Senator  Ted Kennedy.  [76] In 2013, Bo was joined by  Sunny, a female.  [77]\n\n         Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the  LBJ Presidential Library, 2014\n In 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a  Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2019) in neighboring  Kenwood, Chicago.  [78] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend  Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.  [79]\n In December 2007,   Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2019) .  [80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.  [81]  [82] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to  Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.  [83]  [84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.  [85]\n In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.  [86]  [87]\n On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in   Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a  feminist.  [88]  [89]  [90]\n\n  Religious views  [ edit ]\n Obama is a  Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.  [91] He wrote in   The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person  ... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed  atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with  black churches as a  community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"  [92]\n\n         The Obamas worship at  African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013.\n In January 2008, Obama told   Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the  redemptive death and  resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"  [93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper,  treating others as they would treat me.\"  [94]  [95]\n Obama met  Trinity United Church of Christ pastor  Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.  [96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after  some of Wright's statements were criticized.  [97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including  Shiloh Baptist Church and  St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at  Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.  [98]  [99]  [100]\n\n  Law career  [ edit ]\n  Community organizer and Harvard Law School  [ edit ]\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the  Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in  Roseland,  West Pullman, and  Riverdale on Chicago's  South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.  [51]  [101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens.  [102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.  [103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives for the first time.  [104]  [105]\n\n  External video      Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34,  Boston TV Digital Archive  [106] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.\n Despite being offered a full scholarship to  Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at  Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby  Somerville, Massachusetts.  [107] He was selected as an editor of the   Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,  [108] president of the journal in his second year,  [102]  [109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar  Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.  [110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a  summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley Austin in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.  [111] After graduating with a  JD degree   magna cum laude  [112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.  [108] Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review gained national media attention  [102]  [109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,  [113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as   Dreams from My Father.  [113]\n\n  Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney  [ edit ]\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the  University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.  [113]  [114] He then taught  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a  lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.  [115]\n From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote, a  voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading   Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.  [116]\n He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in  Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).  [117] This  class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the  Fair Housing Act.  [118] The case was settled out of court.  [119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.  [120] His law license became inactive in 2007.  [121]  [122]\n From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the  Joyce Foundation.  [51] He served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.  [51]\n\n  Legislative career  [ edit ]\n   Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama\n         State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after  ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998.\n Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator  Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park– Kenwood south to  South Shore and west to  Chicago Lawn.  [123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.  [124]  [125] He sponsored a law that increased  tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated  welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.  [126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's  payday loan regulations and  predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home  foreclosures.  [127]  [128]\n He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.  [129]  [130] In 2000, he lost a  Democratic primary race for  Illinois's 1st congressional district in the  United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.  [131]\n In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.  [132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.  [126]  [133]  [134]  [135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty reforms.  [136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.  [137]\n\n  2004 U.S. Senate campaign  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2004 United States Senate election in Illinois\n         Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue.\n In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant  David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.  [138]\n Obama was an early opponent of the  George W. Bush administration's  2003 invasion of Iraq.  [139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the  joint resolution authorizing the  Iraq War,  [140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally,  [141] and spoke out against the war.  [142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.  [143]\n Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.  [144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the  national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir,  Dreams from My Father.  [145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention,  [146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.  [147]\n Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.  [148] Six weeks later,  Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.  [149] In the  November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.  [150]\n\n   U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama\n         Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,  [151] becoming the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus.  [152]   CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would  resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.  [153]\n\n  Legislation  [ edit ]\n See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate\n Obama  cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  [154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the  Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;  [155] and the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.  [156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators  Tom Carper,  Tom Coburn, and  John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.  [157]\n Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.  [158] Regarding  tort reform, Obama voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.  [159]\n\n         Obama and U.S. Senator  Richard Lugar (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005)  [160]\n In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.  [161]  [162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.  [163]  [164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,  [165]  [166] and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.  [167]\n Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.  [168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.  [169] He sponsored the  Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the  Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;  [170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.  [171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.  [172]\n\n  Committees  [ edit ]\n         Obama speaks with a soldier stationed in Iraq, 2006.\n Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations,  Environment and Public Works and  Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.  [173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  [174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs.  [175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became  President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.  [176]\n\n  Presidential campaigns  [ edit ]\n  2008  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2008 United States presidential election,  Barack Obama 2008 presidential primary campaign, and  Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign\n         Obama on stage with his wife and daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in  Springfield, Illinois, February 10, 2007\n On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the  Old State Capitol building in  Springfield, Illinois.  [177]  [178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic  \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.  [177]  [179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War, increasing  energy independence, and  reforming the health care system,  [180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.  [181]\n Numerous candidates entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged  delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in  caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.  [182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.  [183]\n\n         Outgoing President  George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the  Oval Office on November 10, 2008.\n On August 23, Obama announced his selection of  Delaware Senator  Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.  [184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator  Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor  Tim Kaine.  [184] At the  Democratic National Convention in  Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and  Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.  [185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at  Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.  [186]  [187]  [188]\n During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.  [189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.  [190]\n\n         2008 electoral vote results\n John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected  Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three  presidential debates in September and October 2008.  [191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365  electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.  [192] Obama won 52.9% of the  popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.  [193] He became the first African American to be elected president.  [194] Obama delivered  his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park.  [195]\n\n  2012  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2012 United States presidential election and  Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign\n         Obama greets former Governor  Mitt Romney in the  Oval Office on November 29, 2012, in their first meeting since Obama's re-election victory over Romney.\n On April 4, 2011, Obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the  Federal Election Commission.  [196]  [197]  [198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the  Democratic Party presidential primaries,  [199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778  convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.  [200]\n\n         2012 electoral vote results\n At the  Democratic National Convention in  Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and  Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President  Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans  Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative  Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  [201]\n On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332  electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.  [202]  [203]  [204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,  [205] Obama became the first Democratic president since  Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the  majority of the popular vote twice.  [206]  [207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's  McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"  [208]  [209]\n\n   Presidency (2009–2017)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see  Timeline of the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n See also:  Confirmations of Barack Obama's Cabinet and  List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama\n  First 100 days  [ edit ]\n Main article:  First 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency\n         Barack Obama takes  the oath of office administered by  Chief Justice  John G. Roberts Jr. at  the Capitol, January 20, 2009\n The  inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued  executive orders and  presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.  [210] He ordered the closing of the  Guantanamo Bay detention camp,  [211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds  [212]  [213]  [214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.  [215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.  [216] He also revoked President  George W. Bush's restoration of President  Ronald Reagan's  Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.  [217]\n\n  Domestic policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration\n The first bill signed into law by Obama was the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the  statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.  [218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4 million uninsured children.  [219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of  embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.  [220]\n\n         Obama delivers a  speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President  Joe Biden and  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009.\n Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated  Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring  Associate Justice  David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,  [221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of  Hispanic descent.  [222] Obama nominated  Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice  John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.  [223]\n On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a  reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the  Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  [224]  [225]\n\n         Obama meets with the  Cabinet of the United States, November 23, 2009.\n In a  major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at  NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of  human spaceflight to the moon and development of the  Ares I rocket,  Ares V rocket and  Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the  International Space Station.  [226]\n President Obama's  2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of  innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional  earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \" clean\" electricity.  [227]  [228]\n\n  LGBT rights  [ edit ]\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the  1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  [229]\n On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with  HIV, which was celebrated by  Immigration Equality.  [230]\n On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign  [231]  [232] to end the  Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the  United States Armed Forces.  [233] In 2016, the  Pentagon also ended the policy that barred  transgender people from serving openly in the military.  [234]\n As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing  same-sex marriage.  [235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.  [236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"  [237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.  [238]  [239]\n\n         The  White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.\n During his second  inaugural address on January 21, 2013,  [209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned  gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.  [240]  [241]\n In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of   Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding  same-sex marriage)  [242] and   United States v. Windsor (regarding the  Defense of Marriage Act).  [243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in   Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"  [244]\n On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the  Human Rights Campaign.  [245]\n\n  White House advisory and oversight groups  [ edit ]\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the  White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the  Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by  Executive Order  13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.  [246] The Council was chaired by  Senior Advisor to the President  Valerie Jarrett.  [247] Obama also established the  White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.  [247]  [248]  [249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President  Joe Biden and Jarrett.  [248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and  Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994  Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.  [250]\n\n  Economic policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration\n       Play media     Obama presents his first  weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion  economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the  deepening worldwide recession.  [251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and  incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.  [252]\n\n          Deficit and  debt increases, 2001–16\n In March, Obama's  Treasury Secretary,  Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the  financial crisis, including introducing the  Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.  [253]\n Obama intervened in the  troubled automotive industry  [254] in March 2009, renewing loans for  General Motors and  Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the  sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker  Fiat  [255] and a  reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.  [256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.  [257] He signed into law the  Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.  [258]  [259]  [260]\n The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the  Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.  [261] Obama and the  Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010  budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's  gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.  [262]  [263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.  [264] The most recent increase in the U.S.  debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.  [265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan  Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.  [266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a  U.S. government  default on its obligations.  [267]\n\n         US employment statistics ( unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama's tenure as U.S. President  [268]  [269]\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.  [270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.  [271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,  [272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.  [273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.  [274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.  [275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.  [275] In July 2010, the  Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman  Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"  [276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.  [277]\n The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.  [278]  [279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,  [279]  [280]  [281]  [282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"  [278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the  National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.  [283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original  NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of  World War II.  [284] The  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.  [285]\n Within a month of the  2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the  2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year  payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for  estate taxes.  [286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.  [287]\n In December 2013, Obama declared that growing  income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the  nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and  Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and  trickle-down economics.  [288]\n Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.  [289]\n\n  Environmental policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Climate change policy of the United States\n         Obama at a 2010 briefing on the  BP oil spill at the  Coast Guard Station Venice in  Venice, Louisiana\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb  global warming.  [290]  [291]\n On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore  drilling rig at the  Macondo Prospect in the  Gulf of Mexico, causing a  major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by  Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new  deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.  [292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.  [293]\n In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the  Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"  [294]  [295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to  petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.  [296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.  [297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.  [298]\n Obama emphasized the  conservation of  federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the  Antiquities Act to create 25 new  national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.  [299]  [300]  [301]  [302]\n\n  Health care reform  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Health care reform in the United States\n         Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010.\n Obama called for  Congress to pass legislation reforming  health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.  [303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the  public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for  pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.  [304]  [305]\n\n         Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and  federal poverty level, under  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:  CRS)  [306]\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.  [303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered  a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.  [307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.  [308]\n On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.  [309]  [310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.  [311] On March 21, 2010, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.  [312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.  [313]\n The ACA includes  health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding  Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the  federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,  [314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,  [315]  [316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing  health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  [315]  [317]\n\n         Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source:  JAMA)  [318]\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income  brackets, taxes on  indoor tanning, cuts to the  Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;  [319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.  [320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.  [321]\n The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in   National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.  [322] In   Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in   King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.  [323]\n\n  Energy policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Energy policy of the Obama administration\n Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic  energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his  State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.  [324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.  [325]  [326]\n\n  Gun control  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy\n         Obama visits an  Aurora shooting victim at  University of Colorado Hospital, 2012.\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding  gun control.  [327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an  expired ban on military-style  assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.  [328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.  [329] In a 2016 editorial in the  New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to  women's suffrage and other  civil rights movements in American history.  [330]\n\n  2010 midterm elections  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2010 United States House of Representatives elections and  2010 United States Senate elections\n Obama called the  November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,  [331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"  [332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.  [333]\n\n  Cybersecurity and Internet policy  [ edit ]\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the  Federal Communications Commission reclassify  broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve  net neutrality.  [334]  [335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed  Executive Order  13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"  [336]\n\n  Government mass surveillance  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama on mass surveillance\n In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the  Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.  [337]  [338]  [339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.  [339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.  [340] Following the  2013 global surveillance disclosures by  whistleblower  Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,  [338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.  [341]  [342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.  [343]\n\n  Foreign policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration\n         June 4, 2009 − after his speech   A New Beginning at  Cairo University, U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others  Jamal Khashoggi,  Bambang Harymurti and  Nahum Barnea.\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \" reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.  [344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network,  Al Arabiya.  [345]\n On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.  [346]  [347] In April, Obama gave a speech in  Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.  [348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at  Cairo University in Egypt calling for \" A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.  [349]\n\n          International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office\n         Obama with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in 2011\n On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following  Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"  [350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"  [351]\n On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to  preside over a meeting of the  United Nations Security Council.  [352]\n In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of  East Jerusalem.  [353]  [354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev to replace the  1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.  [355] Obama and Medvedev signed the  New START treaty in April 2010, and the  U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.  [356]\n\n         Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister  Matteo Renzi at the  White House, October 2016.\n In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider  LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.  [357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,  [358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming  2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, Russia.  [359]\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to  normalize relationships between  Cuba and the United States.  [360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\n In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their  military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.  [361]  [362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of  arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.  [363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to  Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes  targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.  [364]\n Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor  Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.  [365]\n\n  War in Iraq  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  Iraq War and  American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of  Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"  [366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to  counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.  [367]  [368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.  [369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"  [370]\n\n         Meeting with UK Prime Minister  David Cameron during the  2010 G20 Toronto summit\n In June 2014, following the  capture of Mosul by  ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit  widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.  [371]  [372]\n In August 2014, during the  Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a  campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.  [373]\n By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict  [374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.  [375]\n In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the  82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,  [376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.  [377]\n\n  War in Afghanistan  [ edit ]\n Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001–present)\n Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.  [378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"  [379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General  David D. McKiernan, with former  Special Forces commander Lt. Gen.  Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.  [380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;  [381] this took place in July 2011.  David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.  [382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.  [383]\n In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.  [384]\n\n  Israel  [ edit ]\n         Obama meeting with Israeli President  Shimon Peres in the  Oval Office, May 2009\n In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning  Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.  [385] Obama supports the  two-state solution to the  Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.  [386]\n In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"  [387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the  U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.  [388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the  Iron Dome program in response to the waves of  Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.  [389]\n In 2013,  Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"  [390] In 2014, Obama likened the  Zionist movement to the  Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"  [391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the  2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.  [392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the  Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"  [393]\n On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned  Israeli settlement building in the occupied  Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.  [394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,  [395]  [396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.  [397] On January 5, 2017, the  United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.  [398]  [399]\n\n  Libya  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2011 military intervention in Libya\n         President Obama meets with Russian President  Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015.\n In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator  Muammar Gaddafi as part of the  Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the  Arab League, and a resolution  [400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.  [401] In response to the unanimous passage of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi  [402]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,  [403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling  Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,  [404] including the use of  Tomahawk missiles,  B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.  [405]  [406]  [407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members,  NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed  Operation Unified Protector.  [408] Some Representatives  [409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.  [410]  [411]\n\n  Syrian Civil War  [ edit ]\n See also:  Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the  Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for  President Assad to step aside.\"  [412]  [413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.  [414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple  programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.  [415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.  [416]  [417]\n In the wake of a  chemical weapons attack in Syria,  formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged  [418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad  giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with  chlorine gas continued.  [419]  [420] In 2014, Obama authorized an  air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.  [421]  [422]\n\n  Death of Osama bin Laden  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Death of Osama bin Laden\n       Play media     President Obama's address (9:28)   Also available:  Audio only;  Full text   \n         Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on  Operation Neptune's Spear in the  White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011. See also:   Situation Room\n Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of  Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in  a large compound in  Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from  Islamabad.  [423] CIA head  Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.  [423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by  United States Navy SEALs.  [423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.  [424]  [425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,  [426] which was buried at sea several hours later.  [427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's  Ground Zero and  Times Square.  [424]  [428]  Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  [429]\n\n \n  Iran nuclear talks  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n         Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013.\n In November 2013, the Obama administration opened  negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring  nuclear weapons, which included an  interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \" Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.  [430]  [431]  [432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"  [433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded  Hezbollah from the  Drug Enforcement Administration's  Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the  Central Intelligence Agency.  [434]  [435]\n\n  Relations with Cuba  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States–Cuban Thaw\n         President Obama meeting with Cuban President  Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015\n Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and  Vatican City.  [436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when  Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to  exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.  [437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President  Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the  Nelson Mandela memorial service in  Johannesburg.  [438]\n In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with  Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.  [439] Popularly dubbed the  Cuban Thaw,   The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"  [440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and  Havana.  [441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.  [442]\n Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since  Calvin Coolidge in 1928.  [443]\n\n  Africa  [ edit ]\n Obama spoke in front of the  African Union in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in  education, infrastructure, and  economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities ( LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified  democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.  [444]  [445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to  visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.  [446]\n\n  Hiroshima speech  [ edit ]\n On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit  Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the  U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended  World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzō Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the  Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  [447]\n\n  Russia  [ edit ]\n See also:  Russia–United States relations § Obama's tenure (2009–17)\n         Obama meets Russian President  Vladimir Putin in September 2015.\n After  Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014,  military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the  interference in the  2016 U.S. presidential election,  [448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.  [449]  George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.  [450]\n\n  Cultural and political image  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama\n See also:  International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election and  International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election\n Obama's family history, upbringing, and  Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement.  [451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"  [452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"  [453]\n Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.  [454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.  [455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,  [456]  [457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.  [458]\n\n         Presidential approval ratings\n According to the  Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating  [459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,  [460] a trend similar to  Ronald Reagan's and  Bill Clinton's first years in office.  [461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the  death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.  [462]  [463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.  [464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.  [465]\n Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.  [466]  [467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by  Harris Interactive for  France 24 and the   International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.  [468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  [469]  [470]\n\n         G8 leaders watching the  2012 UEFA Champions League Final\n Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album  Grammy Awards for abridged  audiobook versions of   Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for   The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.  [471] His  concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \" Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10 million times on YouTube in its first month  [472] and received a  Daytime Emmy Award.  [473] In December 2008 and in 2012,   Time magazine named Obama as its  Person of the Year.  [474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which  Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"  [475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the  UK Parliament in  Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following  Charles de Gaulle in 1960,  Nelson Mandela in 1996,  Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and  Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.  [476]  [477]\n On October 9, 2009, the  Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"  [478] Obama accepted this award in  Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"  [479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.  [480]  [481]  [482]  [483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by   The New York Times.  [484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.  [485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute,  Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.  [486]\n\n   Post-presidency (2017–present)  [ edit ]\n         Obama, with  Joe Biden and  Donald Trump at the latter's  inauguration on January 20, 2017\n Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the  inauguration of his Republican successor,  Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on  Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to  Joint Base Andrews.  [487] The family currently rents a house in  Kalorama, Washington, D.C.  [488]\n On March 2, 2017, the  John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual  Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"  [489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the  University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.  [490] On May 4, three days ahead of the  French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed  Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"  [491] Macron went on to win the election.\n While in  Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor  Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.  [492] Obama traveled to  Kensington Palace in England and met with  Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the  Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.  [493]\n After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the  Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"  [494]\n\n         Obama playing golf with the President of Argentina  Mauricio Macri, October 2017\n After Senate Republicans revealed the  Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"  [495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"  [496]\n After Attorney General  Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.  [497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents  Jimmy Carter,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush to work with  One America Appeal to help the victims of  Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Irma in the  Gulf Coast and  Texas communities.  [498]\n Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the  Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.  [499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with  Penguin Random House.  [500]\n Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President  Xi Jinping in Beijing.  [501]  [502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.  [503]  [504] He also met with the  Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.  [505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President  Emmanuel Macron, former President  Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor  Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.  [506]\n Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for  Netflix under the Obamas’ newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"  [507]  [508] Higher Ground's first film,   American Factory, won the  Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.  [509]\n A package that contained a  pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of  Donald Trump and to  CNN.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018,  Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.  [510]  [511]\n In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on  Martha's Vineyard from  Wyc Grousbeck.  [512]  [513]\n\n  Legacy  [ edit ]\n         Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to predecessors, as measured as cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term\n Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.  [514] Together with the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the  U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of  Medicare and  Medicaid in 1965.  [515]  [516]  [517]  [518]\n Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened  depression and pulling the economy back from the  Great Recession.  [514] According to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the  Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after  his first inauguration to the end of his term.  [519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the  financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to  financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the  Great Depression under Democratic President  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  [520]\n In 2009, Obama signed into law the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President  Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded  existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\n As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.  [521] In 2010, he signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \" don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from  LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.  [522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on  transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.  [523]  [234] A  Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.  [524]\n Obama substantially escalated the use of  drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with  al-Qaeda and the  Taliban.  [525]  [526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.  [527]  [528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in  Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.  [529]  [530]\n According to  Pew Research Center and  United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President  Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents  Ronald Reagan,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush.  [531]\n Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.  [532]  [533] A 2018 survey of historians by the  American Political Science Association ranked Obama the  8th-greatest American President.  [4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the  Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.  [534]\n\n  Presidential library  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama Presidential Center\n The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned  presidential library.

A member of the  Democratic Party, he was the first  African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a  U.S. senator from  Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an  Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\n Obama was born in  Honolulu,  Hawaii. After graduating from  Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in  Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in  Harvard Law School, where he was the first black person to head the   Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the  University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he  represented the 13th district for three terms in the  Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he  ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July  Democratic National Convention  keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after  his presidential campaign began, and after  close primary campaigns against  Hillary Clinton. Obama was  elected over  Republican  John McCain and was  inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n Regarded as a  centrist  New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the  Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the  Budget Control and the  American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in  Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia  New START treaty, and  ended military involvement in the  Iraq War. He ordered  military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of  Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in  the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni  Al-Qaeda operative  Anwar al-Awlaki.\n After winning  re-election by defeating Republican opponent  Mitt Romney, Obama was  sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for  LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to strike down  same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (  United States v. Windsor and   Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was  legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in   Obergefell. He advocated for  gun control in response to the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on  assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning  global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered  military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by  ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of  ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015  Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated  sanctions against Russia following the  invasion in Ukraine and again after  Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a  nuclear deal with Iran, and  normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated  three justices to the Supreme Court:  Sonia Sotomayor and  Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while  Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan  obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's  soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.  [2]\n Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among  the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in  Washington, D.C.  [3]  [4] A December 2019  Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.

[7]  [8]  [9] He is the only president born outside the  contiguous 48 states.  [10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother,  Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in  Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,  [11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.  [12] His father,  Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),  [13] was a married  [14]  [15]  [16]  Luo Kenyan from  Nyang'oma Kogelo.  [14]  [17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language class at the  University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.  [18]  [19] The couple married in  Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.  [20]  [21]\n In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the  University of Washington in  Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in  economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at  Harvard University, where he earned an  M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.  [22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.  [23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,  [24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.  [25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"  [19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.  [26]\n\n         Obama (right) with  his father in  Hawaii, 1971\n In 1963, Dunham met  Lolo Soetoro at the  University of Hawaii; he was an  Indonesian  East–West Center  graduate student in  geography. The couple married on  Molokai on March 15, 1965.  [27] After two one-year extensions of his  J-1 visa, Lolo returned to  Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the  Tebet sub district of  south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the  Menteng sub district of  central Jakarta.  [28]\n\n  Education  [ edit ]\n Obama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local  Indonesian-language schools:  Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and   Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language  Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.  [29]  [30] As a result of those four years in  Jakarta, he was able to speak  Indonesian fluently as a child.  [31]  [32]  [33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"  [34]\n In 1971, Obama returned to  Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn and  Stanley Dunham. He attended  Punahou School—a private  college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.  [35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"  [36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,  Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in  anthropology at the  University of Hawaii.  [37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at  Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.  [38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a  PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for  ovarian and  uterine cancer.  [39]\n Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"  [40] Obama has also written and talked about using  alcohol,  marijuana, and  cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"  [41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  [42]  [43]\n After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to  Los Angeles to attend  Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the  disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of  apartheid.  [44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in  Pakistan and  India for three weeks.  [44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to  Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in  political science with a specialty in  international relations  [45] and in  English literature  [46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.  [47] He graduated with a  BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the  Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,  [48]  [49] then as a project coordinator for the  New York Public Interest Research Group on the  City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.  [50]  [51]  [52]\n\n  Family and personal life  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Family of Barack Obama\n         Obama poses in the  Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009.\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of  his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher.\"  [53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living.  [54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,  Madelyn Dunham,  [55] until her death on November 2, 2008,  [56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in  Moneygall in May 2011.  [57] In  Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis,  President of the Confederate States of America during the  American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with  George W. Bush and  Dick Cheney, among others.  [58]  [59]  [60]\n\n         Obama with  Jonathan Toews and the  Stanley Cup champion  Chicago Blackhawks, 2010\n Obama is a supporter of the  Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the  2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.  [61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the  All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.  [62] He is also primarily a  Chicago Bears football fan in the  NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a  fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in  Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.  [63] In 2011, Obama invited the  1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their  Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the  Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  [64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,  [65] and he is left-handed.  [66]\n\n         Obama takes a left-handed  jump shot during a  pickup game on the  White House basketball court, 2009.\n Obama lived with anthropologist  Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.  [67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.  [67]  [68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  [68]\n In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin.  [69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.  [70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.  [71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent  in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.  [72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,  [73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.  [74] The Obama daughters attended the  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the  Sidwell Friends School.  [75] The Obamas have two  Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named  Bo, was a gift from Senator  Ted Kennedy.  [76] In 2013, Bo was joined by  Sunny, a female.  [77]\n\n         Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the  LBJ Presidential Library, 2014\n In 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a  Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2019) in neighboring  Kenwood, Chicago.  [78] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend  Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.  [79]\n In December 2007,   Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2019) .  [80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.  [81]  [82] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to  Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.  [83]  [84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.  [85]\n In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.  [86]  [87]\n On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in   Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a  feminist.  [88]  [89]  [90]\n\n  Religious views  [ edit ]\n Obama is a  Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.  [91] He wrote in   The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person  ... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed  atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with  black churches as a  community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"  [92]\n\n         The Obamas worship at  African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013.\n In January 2008, Obama told   Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the  redemptive death and  resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"  [93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper,  treating others as they would treat me.\"  [94]  [95]\n Obama met  Trinity United Church of Christ pastor  Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.  [96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after  some of Wright's statements were criticized.  [97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including  Shiloh Baptist Church and  St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at  Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.  [98]  [99]  [100]\n\n  Law career  [ edit ]\n  Community organizer and Harvard Law School  [ edit ]\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the  Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in  Roseland,  West Pullman, and  Riverdale on Chicago's  South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.  [51]  [101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens.  [102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.  [103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives for the first time.  [104]  [105]\n\n  External video      Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34,  Boston TV Digital Archive  [106] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.\n Despite being offered a full scholarship to  Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at  Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby  Somerville, Massachusetts.  [107] He was selected as an editor of the   Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,  [108] president of the journal in his second year,  [102]  [109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar  Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.  [110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a  summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley Austin in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.  [111] After graduating with a  JD degree   magna cum laude  [112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.  [108] Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review gained national media attention  [102]  [109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,  [113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as   Dreams from My Father.  [113]\n\n  Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney  [ edit ]\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the  University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.  [113]  [114] He then taught  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a  lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.  [115]\n From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote, a  voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading   Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.  [116]\n He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in  Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).  [117] This  class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the  Fair Housing Act.  [118] The case was settled out of court.  [119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.  [120] His law license became inactive in 2007.  [121]  [122]\n From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the  Joyce Foundation.  [51] He served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.  [51]\n\n  Legislative career  [ edit ]\n   Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama\n         State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after  ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998.\n Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator  Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park– Kenwood south to  South Shore and west to  Chicago Lawn.  [123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.  [124]  [125] He sponsored a law that increased  tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated  welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.  [126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's  payday loan regulations and  predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home  foreclosures.  [127]  [128]\n He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.  [129]  [130] In 2000, he lost a  Democratic primary race for  Illinois's 1st congressional district in the  United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.  [131]\n In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.  [132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.  [126]  [133]  [134]  [135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty reforms.  [136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.  [137]\n\n  2004 U.S. Senate campaign  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2004 United States Senate election in Illinois\n         Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue.\n In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant  David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.  [138]\n Obama was an early opponent of the  George W. Bush administration's  2003 invasion of Iraq.  [139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the  joint resolution authorizing the  Iraq War,  [140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally,  [141] and spoke out against the war.  [142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.  [143]\n Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.  [144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the  national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir,  Dreams from My Father.  [145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention,  [146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.  [147]\n Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.  [148] Six weeks later,  Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.  [149] In the  November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.  [150]\n\n   U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama\n         Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,  [151] becoming the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus.  [152]   CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would  resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.  [153]\n\n  Legislation  [ edit ]\n See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate\n Obama  cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  [154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the  Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;  [155] and the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.  [156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators  Tom Carper,  Tom Coburn, and  John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.  [157]\n Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.  [158] Regarding  tort reform, Obama voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.  [159]\n\n         Obama and U.S. Senator  Richard Lugar (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005)  [160]\n In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.  [161]  [162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.  [163]  [164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,  [165]  [166] and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.  [167]\n Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.  [168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.  [169] He sponsored the  Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the  Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;  [170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.  [171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.  [172]\n\n  Committees  [ edit ]\n         Obama speaks with a soldier stationed in Iraq, 2006.\n Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations,  Environment and Public Works and  Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.  [173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  [174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs.  [175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became  President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.

[177]  [178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic  \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.  [177]  [179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War, increasing  energy independence, and  reforming the health care system,  [180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.  [181]\n Numerous candidates entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged  delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in  caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.  [182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.  [183]\n\n         Outgoing President  George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the  Oval Office on November 10, 2008.\n On August 23, Obama announced his selection of  Delaware Senator  Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.  [184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator  Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor  Tim Kaine.  [184] At the  Democratic National Convention in  Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and  Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.  [185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at  Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.  [186]  [187]  [188]\n During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.  [189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.  [190]\n\n         2008 electoral vote results\n John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected  Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three  presidential debates in September and October 2008.  [191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365  electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.  [192] Obama won 52.9% of the  popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.  [193] He became the first African American to be elected president.  [194] Obama delivered  his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park.

[196]  [197]  [198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the  Democratic Party presidential primaries,  [199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778  convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.  [200]\n\n         2012 electoral vote results\n At the  Democratic National Convention in  Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and  Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President  Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans  Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative  Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  [201]\n On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332  electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.  [202]  [203]  [204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,  [205] Obama became the first Democratic president since  Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the  majority of the popular vote twice.  [206]  [207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's  McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"  [208]  [209]\n\n   Presidency (2009–2017)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see  Timeline of the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n See also:  Confirmations of Barack Obama's Cabinet and  List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama\n  First 100 days  [ edit ]\n Main article:  First 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency\n         Barack Obama takes  the oath of office administered by  Chief Justice  John G. Roberts Jr. at  the Capitol, January 20, 2009\n The  inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued  executive orders and  presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.  [210] He ordered the closing of the  Guantanamo Bay detention camp,  [211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds  [212]  [213]  [214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.  [215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.  [216] He also revoked President  George W. Bush's restoration of President  Ronald Reagan's  Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.  [217]\n\n  Domestic policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration\n The first bill signed into law by Obama was the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the  statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.  [218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4 million uninsured children.  [219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of  embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.  [220]\n\n         Obama delivers a  speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President  Joe Biden and  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009.\n Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated  Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring  Associate Justice  David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,  [221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of  Hispanic descent.  [222] Obama nominated  Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice  John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.  [223]\n On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a  reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the  Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  [224]  [225]\n\n         Obama meets with the  Cabinet of the United States, November 23, 2009.\n In a  major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at  NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of  human spaceflight to the moon and development of the  Ares I rocket,  Ares V rocket and  Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the  International Space Station.  [226]\n President Obama's  2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of  innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional  earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \" clean\" electricity.  [227]  [228]\n\n  LGBT rights  [ edit ]\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the  1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  [229]\n On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with  HIV, which was celebrated by  Immigration Equality.  [230]\n On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign  [231]  [232] to end the  Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the  United States Armed Forces.  [233] In 2016, the  Pentagon also ended the policy that barred  transgender people from serving openly in the military.  [234]\n As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing  same-sex marriage.  [235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.  [236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"  [237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.  [238]  [239]\n\n         The  White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.\n During his second  inaugural address on January 21, 2013,  [209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned  gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.  [240]  [241]\n In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of   Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding  same-sex marriage)  [242] and   United States v. Windsor (regarding the  Defense of Marriage Act).  [243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in   Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"  [244]\n On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the  Human Rights Campaign.  [245]\n\n  White House advisory and oversight groups  [ edit ]\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the  White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the  Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by  Executive Order  13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.  [246] The Council was chaired by  Senior Advisor to the President  Valerie Jarrett.  [247] Obama also established the  White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.  [247]  [248]  [249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President  Joe Biden and Jarrett.  [248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and  Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994  Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.  [250]\n\n  Economic policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration\n       Play media     Obama presents his first  weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion  economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the  deepening worldwide recession.  [251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and  incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.  [252]\n\n          Deficit and  debt increases, 2001–16\n In March, Obama's  Treasury Secretary,  Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the  financial crisis, including introducing the  Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.  [253]\n Obama intervened in the  troubled automotive industry  [254] in March 2009, renewing loans for  General Motors and  Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the  sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker  Fiat  [255] and a  reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.  [256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.  [257] He signed into law the  Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.  [258]  [259]  [260]\n The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the  Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.  [261] Obama and the  Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010  budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's  gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.  [262]  [263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.  [264] The most recent increase in the U.S.  debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.  [265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan  Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.  [266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a  U.S. government  default on its obligations.  [267]\n\n         US employment statistics ( unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama's tenure as U.S. President  [268]  [269]\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.  [270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.  [271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,  [272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.  [273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.  [274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.  [275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.  [275] In July 2010, the  Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman  Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"  [276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.  [277]\n The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.  [278]  [279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,  [279]  [280]  [281]  [282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"  [278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the  National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.  [283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original  NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of  World War II.  [284] The  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.  [285]\n Within a month of the  2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the  2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year  payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for  estate taxes.  [286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.  [287]\n In December 2013, Obama declared that growing  income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the  nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and  Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and  trickle-down economics.  [288]\n Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.  [289]\n\n  Environmental policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Climate change policy of the United States\n         Obama at a 2010 briefing on the  BP oil spill at the  Coast Guard Station Venice in  Venice, Louisiana\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb  global warming.  [290]  [291]\n On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore  drilling rig at the  Macondo Prospect in the  Gulf of Mexico, causing a  major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by  Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new  deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.  [292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.  [293]\n In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the  Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"  [294]  [295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to  petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.  [296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.  [297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.  [298]\n Obama emphasized the  conservation of  federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the  Antiquities Act to create 25 new  national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.  [299]  [300]  [301]  [302]\n\n  Health care reform  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Health care reform in the United States\n         Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010.\n Obama called for  Congress to pass legislation reforming  health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.  [303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the  public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for  pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.  [304]  [305]\n\n         Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and  federal poverty level, under  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:  CRS)  [306]\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.  [303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered  a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.  [307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.  [308]\n On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.  [309]  [310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.  [311] On March 21, 2010, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.  [312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.  [313]\n The ACA includes  health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding  Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the  federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,  [314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,  [315]  [316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing  health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  [315]  [317]\n\n         Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source:  JAMA)  [318]\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income  brackets, taxes on  indoor tanning, cuts to the  Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;  [319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.  [320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.  [321]\n The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in   National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.  [322] In   Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in   King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.  [323]\n\n  Energy policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Energy policy of the Obama administration\n Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic  energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his  State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.  [324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.  [325]  [326]\n\n  Gun control  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy\n         Obama visits an  Aurora shooting victim at  University of Colorado Hospital, 2012.\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding  gun control.  [327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an  expired ban on military-style  assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.  [328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.  [329] In a 2016 editorial in the  New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to  women's suffrage and other  civil rights movements in American history.  [330]\n\n  2010 midterm elections  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2010 United States House of Representatives elections and  2010 United States Senate elections\n Obama called the  November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,  [331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"  [332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.  [333]\n\n  Cybersecurity and Internet policy  [ edit ]\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the  Federal Communications Commission reclassify  broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve  net neutrality.  [334]  [335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed  Executive Order  13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"  [336]\n\n  Government mass surveillance  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama on mass surveillance\n In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the  Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.  [337]  [338]  [339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.  [339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.  [340] Following the  2013 global surveillance disclosures by  whistleblower  Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,  [338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.  [341]  [342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.  [343]\n\n  Foreign policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration\n         June 4, 2009 − after his speech   A New Beginning at  Cairo University, U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others  Jamal Khashoggi,  Bambang Harymurti and  Nahum Barnea.\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \" reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.  [344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network,  Al Arabiya.  [345]\n On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.  [346]  [347] In April, Obama gave a speech in  Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.  [348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at  Cairo University in Egypt calling for \" A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.  [349]\n\n          International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office\n         Obama with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in 2011\n On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following  Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"  [350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"  [351]\n On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to  preside over a meeting of the  United Nations Security Council.  [352]\n In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of  East Jerusalem.  [353]  [354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev to replace the  1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.  [355] Obama and Medvedev signed the  New START treaty in April 2010, and the  U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.  [356]\n\n         Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister  Matteo Renzi at the  White House, October 2016.\n In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider  LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.  [357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,  [358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming  2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, Russia.  [359]\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to  normalize relationships between  Cuba and the United States.  [360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\n In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their  military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.  [361]  [362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of  arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.  [363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to  Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes  targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.  [364]\n Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor  Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.  [365]\n\n  War in Iraq  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  Iraq War and  American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of  Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"  [366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to  counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.  [367]  [368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.  [369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"  [370]\n\n         Meeting with UK Prime Minister  David Cameron during the  2010 G20 Toronto summit\n In June 2014, following the  capture of Mosul by  ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit  widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.  [371]  [372]\n In August 2014, during the  Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a  campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.  [373]\n By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict  [374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.  [375]\n In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the  82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,  [376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.  [377]\n\n  War in Afghanistan  [ edit ]\n Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001–present)\n Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.  [378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"  [379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General  David D. McKiernan, with former  Special Forces commander Lt. Gen.  Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.  [380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;  [381] this took place in July 2011.  David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.  [382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.  [383]\n In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.  [384]\n\n  Israel  [ edit ]\n         Obama meeting with Israeli President  Shimon Peres in the  Oval Office, May 2009\n In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning  Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.  [385] Obama supports the  two-state solution to the  Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.  [386]\n In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"  [387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the  U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.  [388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the  Iron Dome program in response to the waves of  Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.  [389]\n In 2013,  Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"  [390] In 2014, Obama likened the  Zionist movement to the  Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"  [391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the  2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.  [392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the  Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"  [393]\n On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned  Israeli settlement building in the occupied  Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.  [394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,  [395]  [396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.  [397] On January 5, 2017, the  United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.  [398]  [399]\n\n  Libya  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2011 military intervention in Libya\n         President Obama meets with Russian President  Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015.\n In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator  Muammar Gaddafi as part of the  Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the  Arab League, and a resolution  [400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.  [401] In response to the unanimous passage of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi  [402]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,  [403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling  Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,  [404] including the use of  Tomahawk missiles,  B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.  [405]  [406]  [407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members,  NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed  Operation Unified Protector.  [408] Some Representatives  [409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.  [410]  [411]\n\n  Syrian Civil War  [ edit ]\n See also:  Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the  Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for  President Assad to step aside.\"  [412]  [413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.  [414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple  programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.  [415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.  [416]  [417]\n In the wake of a  chemical weapons attack in Syria,  formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged  [418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad  giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with  chlorine gas continued.  [419]  [420] In 2014, Obama authorized an  air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.  [421]  [422]\n\n  Death of Osama bin Laden  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Death of Osama bin Laden\n       Play media     President Obama's address (9:28)   Also available:  Audio only;  Full text   \n         Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on  Operation Neptune's Spear in the  White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011. See also:   Situation Room\n Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of  Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in  a large compound in  Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from  Islamabad.  [423] CIA head  Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.  [423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by  United States Navy SEALs.  [423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.  [424]  [425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,  [426] which was buried at sea several hours later.  [427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's  Ground Zero and  Times Square.  [424]  [428]  Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  [429]\n\n \n  Iran nuclear talks  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n         Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013.\n In November 2013, the Obama administration opened  negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring  nuclear weapons, which included an  interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \" Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.  [430]  [431]  [432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"  [433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded  Hezbollah from the  Drug Enforcement Administration's  Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the  Central Intelligence Agency.  [434]  [435]\n\n  Relations with Cuba  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States–Cuban Thaw\n         President Obama meeting with Cuban President  Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015\n Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and  Vatican City.  [436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when  Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to  exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.  [437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President  Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the  Nelson Mandela memorial service in  Johannesburg.  [438]\n In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with  Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.  [439] Popularly dubbed the  Cuban Thaw,   The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"  [440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and  Havana.  [441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.  [442]\n Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since  Calvin Coolidge in 1928.  [443]\n\n  Africa  [ edit ]\n Obama spoke in front of the  African Union in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in  education, infrastructure, and  economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities ( LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified  democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.  [444]  [445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to  visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.  [446]\n\n  Hiroshima speech  [ edit ]\n On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit  Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the  U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended  World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzō Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the  Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  [447]\n\n  Russia  [ edit ]\n See also:  Russia–United States relations § Obama's tenure (2009–17)\n         Obama meets Russian President  Vladimir Putin in September 2015.\n After  Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014,  military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the  interference in the  2016 U.S. presidential election,  [448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.  [449]  George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.  [450]\n\n  Cultural and political image  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama\n See also:  International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election and  International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election\n Obama's family history, upbringing, and  Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement.  [451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"  [452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"  [453]\n Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.  [454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.  [455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,  [456]  [457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.  [458]\n\n         Presidential approval ratings\n According to the  Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating  [459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,  [460] a trend similar to  Ronald Reagan's and  Bill Clinton's first years in office.  [461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the  death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.  [462]  [463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.  [464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.  [465]\n Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.  [466]  [467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by  Harris Interactive for  France 24 and the   International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.  [468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  [469]  [470]\n\n         G8 leaders watching the  2012 UEFA Champions League Final\n Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album  Grammy Awards for abridged  audiobook versions of   Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for   The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.  [471] His  concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \" Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10 million times on YouTube in its first month  [472] and received a  Daytime Emmy Award.  [473] In December 2008 and in 2012,   Time magazine named Obama as its  Person of the Year.  [474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which  Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"  [475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the  UK Parliament in  Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following  Charles de Gaulle in 1960,  Nelson Mandela in 1996,  Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and  Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.  [476]  [477]\n On October 9, 2009, the  Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"  [478] Obama accepted this award in  Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"  [479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.  [480]  [481]  [482]  [483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by   The New York Times.  [484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.  [485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute,  Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.  [486]\n\n   Post-presidency (2017–present)  [ edit ]\n         Obama, with  Joe Biden and  Donald Trump at the latter's  inauguration on January 20, 2017\n Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the  inauguration of his Republican successor,  Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on  Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to  Joint Base Andrews.  [487] The family currently rents a house in  Kalorama, Washington, D.C.  [488]\n On March 2, 2017, the  John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual  Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"  [489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the  University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.  [490] On May 4, three days ahead of the  French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed  Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"  [491] Macron went on to win the election.\n While in  Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor  Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.  [492] Obama traveled to  Kensington Palace in England and met with  Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the  Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.  [493]\n After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the  Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"  [494]\n\n         Obama playing golf with the President of Argentina  Mauricio Macri, October 2017\n After Senate Republicans revealed the  Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"  [495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"  [496]\n After Attorney General  Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.  [497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents  Jimmy Carter,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush to work with  One America Appeal to help the victims of  Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Irma in the  Gulf Coast and  Texas communities.  [498]\n Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the  Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.  [499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with  Penguin Random House.  [500]\n Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President  Xi Jinping in Beijing.  [501]  [502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.  [503]  [504] He also met with the  Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.  [505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President  Emmanuel Macron, former President  Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor  Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.  [506]\n Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for  Netflix under the Obamas’ newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"  [507]  [508] Higher Ground's first film,   American Factory, won the  Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.  [509]\n A package that contained a  pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of  Donald Trump and to  CNN.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018,  Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.  [510]  [511]\n In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on  Martha's Vineyard from  Wyc Grousbeck.  [512]  [513]\n\n  Legacy  [ edit ]\n         Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to predecessors, as measured as cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term\n Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.  [514] Together with the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the  U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of  Medicare and  Medicaid in 1965.  [515]  [516]  [517]  [518]\n Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened  depression and pulling the economy back from the  Great Recession.  [514] According to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the  Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after  his first inauguration to the end of his term.  [519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the  financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to  financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the  Great Depression under Democratic President  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  [520]\n In 2009, Obama signed into law the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President  Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded  existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\n As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.  [521] In 2010, he signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \" don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from  LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.  [522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on  transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.  [523]  [234] A  Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.  [524]\n Obama substantially escalated the use of  drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with  al-Qaeda and the  Taliban.  [525]  [526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.  [527]  [528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in  Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.  [529]  [530]\n According to  Pew Research Center and  United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President  Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents  Ronald Reagan,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush.  [531]\n Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.  [532]  [533] A 2018 survey of historians by the  American Political Science Association ranked Obama the  8th-greatest American President.  [4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the  Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.  [534]\n\n  Presidential library  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama Presidential Center\n The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned  presidential library.

A member of the  Democratic Party, he was the first  African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a  U.S. senator from  Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an  Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\n Obama was born in  Honolulu,  Hawaii. After graduating from  Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in  Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in  Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the   Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the  University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he  represented the 13th district for three terms in the  Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he  ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July  Democratic National Convention  keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after  his presidential campaign began, and after  close primary campaigns against  Hillary Clinton. Obama was  elected over  Republican  John McCain and was  inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n Regarded as a  centrist  New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the  Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the  Budget Control and the  American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in  Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia  New START treaty, and  ended military involvement in the  Iraq War. He ordered  military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of  Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in  the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni  Al-Qaeda operative  Anwar al-Awlaki.\n After winning  re-election by defeating Republican opponent  Mitt Romney, Obama was  sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for  LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to strike down  same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (  United States v. Windsor and   Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was  legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in   Obergefell. He advocated for  gun control in response to the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on  assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning  global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered  military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by  ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of  ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015  Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated  sanctions against Russia following the  invasion in Ukraine and again after  Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a  nuclear deal with Iran, and  normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated  three justices to the Supreme Court:  Sonia Sotomayor and  Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while  Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan  obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's  soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.  [2]\n Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among  the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in  Washington, D.C.  [3]  [4] A December 2019  Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.

[7]  [8]  [9] He is the only president born outside the  contiguous 48 states.  [10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother,  Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in  Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,  [11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.  [12] His father,  Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),  [13] was a married  [14]  [15]  [16]  Luo Kenyan from  Nyang'oma Kogelo.  [14]  [17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language class at the  University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.  [18]  [19] The couple married in  Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.  [20]  [21]\n In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the  University of Washington in  Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in  economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at  Harvard University, where he earned an  M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.  [22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.  [23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,  [24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.  [25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"  [19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.  [26]\n\n         Obama (right) with  his father in  Hawaii, 1971\n In 1963, Dunham met  Lolo Soetoro at the  University of Hawaii; he was an  Indonesian  East–West Center  graduate student in  geography. The couple married on  Molokai on March 15, 1965.  [27] After two one-year extensions of his  J-1 visa, Lolo returned to  Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the  Tebet sub district of  south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the  Menteng sub district of  central Jakarta.  [28]\n\n  Education  [ edit ]\n Obama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local  Indonesian-language schools:  Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and   Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language  Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.  [29]  [30] As a result of those four years in  Jakarta, he was able to speak  Indonesian fluently as a child.  [31]  [32]  [33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"  [34]\n In 1971, Obama returned to  Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn and  Stanley Dunham. He attended  Punahou School—a private  college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.  [35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"  [36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,  Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in  anthropology at the  University of Hawaii.  [37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at  Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.  [38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a  PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for  ovarian and  uterine cancer.  [39]\n Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"  [40] Obama has also written and talked about using  alcohol,  marijuana, and  cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"  [41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  [42]  [43]\n After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to  Los Angeles to attend  Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the  disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of  apartheid.  [44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in  Pakistan and  India for three weeks.  [44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to  Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in  political science with a specialty in  international relations  [45] and in  English literature  [46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.  [47] He graduated with a  BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the  Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,  [48]  [49] then as a project coordinator for the  New York Public Interest Research Group on the  City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.  [50]  [51]  [52]\n\n  Family and personal life  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Family of Barack Obama\n         Obama poses in the  Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009.\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of  his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher.\"  [53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living.  [54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,  Madelyn Dunham,  [55] until her death on November 2, 2008,  [56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in  Moneygall in May 2011.  [57] In  Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis,  President of the Confederate States of America during the  American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with  George W. Bush and  Dick Cheney, among others.  [58]  [59]  [60]\n\n         Obama with  Jonathan Toews and the  Stanley Cup champion  Chicago Blackhawks, 2010\n Obama is a supporter of the  Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the  2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.  [61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the  All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.  [62] He is also primarily a  Chicago Bears football fan in the  NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a  fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in  Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.  [63] In 2011, Obama invited the  1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their  Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the  Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  [64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,  [65] and he is left-handed.  [66]\n\n         Obama takes a left-handed  jump shot during a  pickup game on the  White House basketball court, 2009.\n Obama lived with anthropologist  Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.  [67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.  [67]  [68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  [68]\n In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin.  [69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.  [70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.  [71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent  in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.  [72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,  [73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.  [74] The Obama daughters attended the  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the  Sidwell Friends School.  [75] The Obamas have two  Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named  Bo, was a gift from Senator  Ted Kennedy.  [76] In 2013, Bo was joined by  Sunny, a female.  [77]\n\n         Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the  LBJ Presidential Library, 2014\n In 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a  Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2019) in neighboring  Kenwood, Chicago.  [78] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend  Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.  [79]\n In December 2007,   Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2019) .  [80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.  [81]  [82] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to  Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.  [83]  [84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.  [85]\n In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.  [86]  [87]\n On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in   Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a  feminist.  [88]  [89]  [90]\n\n  Religious views  [ edit ]\n Obama is a  Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.  [91] He wrote in   The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person  ... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed  atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with  black churches as a  community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"  [92]\n\n         The Obamas worship at  African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013.\n In January 2008, Obama told   Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the  redemptive death and  resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"  [93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper,  treating others as they would treat me.\"  [94]  [95]\n Obama met  Trinity United Church of Christ pastor  Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.  [96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after  some of Wright's statements were criticized.  [97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including  Shiloh Baptist Church and  St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at  Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.  [98]  [99]  [100]\n\n  Law career  [ edit ]\n  Community organizer and Harvard Law School  [ edit ]\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the  Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in  Roseland,  West Pullman, and  Riverdale on Chicago's  South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.  [51]  [101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens.  [102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.  [103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives for the first time.  [104]  [105]\n\n  External video      Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34,  Boston TV Digital Archive  [106] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.\n Despite being offered a full scholarship to  Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at  Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby  Somerville, Massachusetts.  [107] He was selected as an editor of the   Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,  [108] president of the journal in his second year,  [102]  [109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar  Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.  [110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a  summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley Austin in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.  [111] After graduating with a  JD degree   magna cum laude  [112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.  [108] Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review gained national media attention  [102]  [109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,  [113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as   Dreams from My Father.  [113]\n\n  Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney  [ edit ]\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the  University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.  [113]  [114] He then taught  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a  lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.  [115]\n From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote, a  voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading   Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.  [116]\n He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in  Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).  [117] This  class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the  Fair Housing Act.  [118] The case was settled out of court.  [119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.  [120] His law license became inactive in 2007.  [121]  [122]\n From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the  Joyce Foundation.  [51] He served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.  [51]\n\n  Legislative career  [ edit ]\n   Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama\n         State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after  ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998.\n Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator  Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park– Kenwood south to  South Shore and west to  Chicago Lawn.  [123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.  [124]  [125] He sponsored a law that increased  tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated  welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.  [126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's  payday loan regulations and  predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home  foreclosures.  [127]  [128]\n He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.  [129]  [130] In 2000, he lost a  Democratic primary race for  Illinois's 1st congressional district in the  United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.  [131]\n In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.  [132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.  [126]  [133]  [134]  [135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty reforms.  [136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.  [137]\n\n  2004 U.S. Senate campaign  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2004 United States Senate election in Illinois\n         Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue.\n In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant  David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.  [138]\n Obama was an early opponent of the  George W. Bush administration's  2003 invasion of Iraq.  [139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the  joint resolution authorizing the  Iraq War,  [140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally,  [141] and spoke out against the war.  [142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.  [143]\n Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.  [144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the  national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir,  Dreams from My Father.  [145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention,  [146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.  [147]\n Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.  [148] Six weeks later,  Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.  [149] In the  November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.  [150]\n\n   U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama\n         Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,  [151] becoming the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus.  [152]   CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would  resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.  [153]\n\n  Legislation  [ edit ]\n See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate\n Obama  cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  [154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the  Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;  [155] and the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.  [156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators  Tom Carper,  Tom Coburn, and  John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.  [157]\n Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.  [158] Regarding  tort reform, Obama voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.  [159]\n\n         Obama and U.S. Senator  Richard Lugar (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005)  [160]\n In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.  [161]  [162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.  [163]  [164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,  [165]  [166] and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.  [167]\n Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.  [168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.  [169] He sponsored the  Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the  Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;  [170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.  [171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.  [172]\n\n  Committees  [ edit ]\n         Obama speaks with a soldier stationed in Iraq, 2006.\n Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations,  Environment and Public Works and  Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.  [173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  [174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs.  [175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became  President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.  [176]\n\n  Presidential campaigns  [ edit ]\n  2008  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2008 United States presidential election,  Barack Obama 2008 presidential primary campaign, and  Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign\n         Obama on stage with his wife and daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in  Springfield, Illinois, February 10, 2007\n On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the  Old State Capitol building in  Springfield, Illinois.  [177]  [178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic  \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.  [177]  [179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War, increasing  energy independence, and  reforming the health care system,  [180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.  [181]\n Numerous candidates entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged  delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in  caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.  [182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.  [183]\n\n         Outgoing President  George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the  Oval Office on November 10, 2008.\n On August 23, Obama announced his selection of  Delaware Senator  Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.  [184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator  Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor  Tim Kaine.  [184] At the  Democratic National Convention in  Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and  Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.  [185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at  Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.  [186]  [187]  [188]\n During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.  [189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.  [190]\n\n         2008 electoral vote results\n John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected  Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three  presidential debates in September and October 2008.  [191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365  electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.  [192] Obama won 52.9% of the  popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.  [193] He became the first African American to be elected president.  [194] Obama delivered  his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park.  [195]\n\n  2012  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2012 United States presidential election and  Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign\n         Obama greets former Governor  Mitt Romney in the  Oval Office on November 29, 2012, in their first meeting since Obama's re-election victory over Romney.\n On April 4, 2011, Obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the  Federal Election Commission.  [196]  [197]  [198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the  Democratic Party presidential primaries,  [199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778  convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.  [200]\n\n         2012 electoral vote results\n At the  Democratic National Convention in  Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and  Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President  Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans  Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative  Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  [201]\n On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332  electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.  [202]  [203]  [204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,  [205] Obama became the first Democratic president since  Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the  majority of the popular vote twice.  [206]  [207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's  McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"  [208]  [209]\n\n   Presidency (2009–2017)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see  Timeline of the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n See also:  Confirmations of Barack Obama's Cabinet and  List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama\n  First 100 days  [ edit ]\n Main article:  First 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency\n         Barack Obama takes  the oath of office administered by  Chief Justice  John G. Roberts Jr. at  the Capitol, January 20, 2009\n The  inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued  executive orders and  presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.  [210] He ordered the closing of the  Guantanamo Bay detention camp,  [211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds  [212]  [213]  [214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.  [215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.  [216] He also revoked President  George W. Bush's restoration of President  Ronald Reagan's  Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.  [217]\n\n  Domestic policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration\n The first bill signed into law by Obama was the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the  statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.  [218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4 million uninsured children.  [219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of  embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.  [220]\n\n         Obama delivers a  speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President  Joe Biden and  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009.\n Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated  Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring  Associate Justice  David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,  [221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of  Hispanic descent.  [222] Obama nominated  Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice  John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.  [223]\n On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a  reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the  Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  [224]  [225]\n\n         Obama meets with the  Cabinet of the United States, November 23, 2009.\n In a  major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at  NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of  human spaceflight to the moon and development of the  Ares I rocket,  Ares V rocket and  Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the  International Space Station.  [226]\n President Obama's  2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of  innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional  earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \" clean\" electricity.  [227]  [228]\n\n  LGBT rights  [ edit ]\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the  1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  [229]\n On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with  HIV, which was celebrated by  Immigration Equality.  [230]\n On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign  [231]  [232] to end the  Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the  United States Armed Forces.  [233] In 2016, the  Pentagon also ended the policy that barred  transgender people from serving openly in the military.  [234]\n As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing  same-sex marriage.  [235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.  [236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"  [237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.  [238]  [239]\n\n         The  White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.\n During his second  inaugural address on January 21, 2013,  [209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned  gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.  [240]  [241]\n In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of   Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding  same-sex marriage)  [242] and   United States v. Windsor (regarding the  Defense of Marriage Act).  [243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in   Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"  [244]\n On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the  Human Rights Campaign.  [245]\n\n  White House advisory and oversight groups  [ edit ]\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the  White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the  Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by  Executive Order  13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.  [246] The Council was chaired by  Senior Advisor to the President  Valerie Jarrett.  [247] Obama also established the  White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.  [247]  [248]  [249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President  Joe Biden and Jarrett.  [248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and  Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994  Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.  [250]\n\n  Economic policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration\n       Play media     Obama presents his first  weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion  economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the  deepening worldwide recession.  [251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and  incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.  [252]\n\n          Deficit and  debt increases, 2001–16\n In March, Obama's  Treasury Secretary,  Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the  financial crisis, including introducing the  Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.  [253]\n Obama intervened in the  troubled automotive industry  [254] in March 2009, renewing loans for  General Motors and  Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the  sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker  Fiat  [255] and a  reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.  [256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.  [257] He signed into law the  Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.  [258]  [259]  [260]\n The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the  Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.  [261] Obama and the  Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010  budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's  gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.  [262]  [263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.  [264] The most recent increase in the U.S.  debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.  [265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan  Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.  [266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a  U.S. government  default on its obligations.  [267]\n\n         US employment statistics ( unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama's tenure as U.S. President  [268]  [269]\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.  [270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.  [271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,  [272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.  [273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.  [274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.  [275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.  [275] In July 2010, the  Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman  Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"  [276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.  [277]\n The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.  [278]  [279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,  [279]  [280]  [281]  [282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"  [278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the  National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.  [283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original  NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of  World War II.  [284] The  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.  [285]\n Within a month of the  2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the  2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year  payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for  estate taxes.  [286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.  [287]\n In December 2013, Obama declared that growing  income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the  nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and  Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and  trickle-down economics.  [288]\n Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.  [289]\n\n  Environmental policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Climate change policy of the United States\n         Obama at a 2010 briefing on the  BP oil spill at the  Coast Guard Station Venice in  Venice, Louisiana\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb  global warming.  [290]  [291]\n On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore  drilling rig at the  Macondo Prospect in the  Gulf of Mexico, causing a  major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by  Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new  deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.  [292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.  [293]\n In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the  Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"  [294]  [295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to  petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.  [296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.  [297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.  [298]\n Obama emphasized the  conservation of  federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the  Antiquities Act to create 25 new  national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.  [299]  [300]  [301]  [302]\n\n  Health care reform  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Health care reform in the United States\n         Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010.\n Obama called for  Congress to pass legislation reforming  health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.  [303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the  public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for  pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.  [304]  [305]\n\n         Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and  federal poverty level, under  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:  CRS)  [306]\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.  [303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered  a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.  [307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.  [308]\n On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.  [309]  [310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.  [311] On March 21, 2010, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.  [312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.  [313]\n The ACA includes  health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding  Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the  federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,  [314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,  [315]  [316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing  health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  [315]  [317]\n\n         Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source:  JAMA)  [318]\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income  brackets, taxes on  indoor tanning, cuts to the  Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;  [319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.  [320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.  [321]\n The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in   National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.  [322] In   Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in   King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.  [323]\n\n  Energy policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Energy policy of the Obama administration\n Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic  energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his  State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.  [324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.  [325]  [326]\n\n  Gun control  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy\n         Obama visits an  Aurora shooting victim at  University of Colorado Hospital, 2012.\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding  gun control.  [327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an  expired ban on military-style  assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.  [328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.  [329] In a 2016 editorial in the  New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to  women's suffrage and other  civil rights movements in American history.  [330]\n\n  2010 midterm elections  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2010 United States House of Representatives elections and  2010 United States Senate elections\n Obama called the  November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,  [331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"  [332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.  [333]\n\n  Cybersecurity and Internet policy  [ edit ]\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the  Federal Communications Commission reclassify  broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve  net neutrality.  [334]  [335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed  Executive Order  13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"  [336]\n\n  Government mass surveillance  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama on mass surveillance\n In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the  Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.  [337]  [338]  [339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.  [339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.  [340] Following the  2013 global surveillance disclosures by  whistleblower  Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,  [338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.  [341]  [342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.  [343]\n\n  Foreign policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration\n         June 4, 2009 − after his speech   A New Beginning at  Cairo University, U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others  Jamal Khashoggi,  Bambang Harymurti and  Nahum Barnea.\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \" reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.  [344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network,  Al Arabiya.  [345]\n On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.  [346]  [347] In April, Obama gave a speech in  Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.  [348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at  Cairo University in Egypt calling for \" A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.  [349]\n\n          International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office\n         Obama with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in 2011\n On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following  Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"  [350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"  [351]\n On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to  preside over a meeting of the  United Nations Security Council.  [352]\n In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of  East Jerusalem.  [353]  [354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev to replace the  1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.  [355] Obama and Medvedev signed the  New START treaty in April 2010, and the  U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.  [356]\n\n         Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister  Matteo Renzi at the  White House, October 2016.\n In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider  LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.  [357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,  [358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming  2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, Russia.  [359]\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to  normalize relationships between  Cuba and the United States.  [360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\n In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their  military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.  [361]  [362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of  arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.  [363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to  Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes  targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.  [364]\n Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor  Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.  [365]\n\n  War in Iraq  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  Iraq War and  American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of  Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"  [366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to  counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.  [367]  [368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.  [369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"  [370]\n\n         Meeting with UK Prime Minister  David Cameron during the  2010 G20 Toronto summit\n In June 2014, following the  capture of Mosul by  ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit  widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.  [371]  [372]\n In August 2014, during the  Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a  campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.  [373]\n By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict  [374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.  [375]\n In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the  82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,  [376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.  [377]\n\n  War in Afghanistan  [ edit ]\n Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001–present)\n Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.  [378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"  [379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General  David D. McKiernan, with former  Special Forces commander Lt. Gen.  Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.  [380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;  [381] this took place in July 2011.  David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.  [382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.  [383]\n In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.  [384]\n\n  Israel  [ edit ]\n         Obama meeting with Israeli President  Shimon Peres in the  Oval Office, May 2009\n In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning  Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.  [385] Obama supports the  two-state solution to the  Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.  [386]\n In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"  [387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the  U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.  [388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the  Iron Dome program in response to the waves of  Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.  [389]\n In 2013,  Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"  [390] In 2014, Obama likened the  Zionist movement to the  Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"  [391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the  2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.  [392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the  Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"  [393]\n On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned  Israeli settlement building in the occupied  Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.  [394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,  [395]  [396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.  [397] On January 5, 2017, the  United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.  [398]  [399]\n\n  Libya  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2011 military intervention in Libya\n         President Obama meets with Russian President  Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015.\n In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator  Muammar Gaddafi as part of the  Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the  Arab League, and a resolution  [400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.  [401] In response to the unanimous passage of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi  [402]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,  [403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling  Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,  [404] including the use of  Tomahawk missiles,  B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.  [405]  [406]  [407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members,  NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed  Operation Unified Protector.  [408] Some Representatives  [409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.  [410]  [411]\n\n  Syrian Civil War  [ edit ]\n See also:  Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the  Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for  President Assad to step aside.\"  [412]  [413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.  [414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple  programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.  [415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.  [416]  [417]\n In the wake of a  chemical weapons attack in Syria,  formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged  [418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad  giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with  chlorine gas continued.  [419]  [420] In 2014, Obama authorized an  air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.  [421]  [422]\n\n  Death of Osama bin Laden  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Death of Osama bin Laden\n       Play media     President Obama's address (9:28)   Also available:  Audio only;  Full text   \n         Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on  Operation Neptune's Spear in the  White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011. See also:   Situation Room\n Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of  Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in  a large compound in  Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from  Islamabad.  [423] CIA head  Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.  [423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by  United States Navy SEALs.  [423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.  [424]  [425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,  [426] which was buried at sea several hours later.  [427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's  Ground Zero and  Times Square.  [424]  [428]  Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  [429]\n\n \n  Iran nuclear talks  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n         Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013.\n In November 2013, the Obama administration opened  negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring  nuclear weapons, which included an  interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \" Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.  [430]  [431]  [432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"  [433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded  Hezbollah from the  Drug Enforcement Administration's  Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the  Central Intelligence Agency.  [434]  [435]\n\n  Relations with Cuba  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States–Cuban Thaw\n         President Obama meeting with Cuban President  Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015\n Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and  Vatican City.  [436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when  Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to  exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.  [437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President  Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the  Nelson Mandela memorial service in  Johannesburg.  [438]\n In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with  Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.  [439] Popularly dubbed the  Cuban Thaw,   The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"  [440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and  Havana.  [441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.  [442]\n Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since  Calvin Coolidge in 1928.  [443]\n\n  Africa  [ edit ]\n Obama spoke in front of the  African Union in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in  education, infrastructure, and  economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities ( LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified  democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.  [444]  [445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to  visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.  [446]\n\n  Hiroshima speech  [ edit ]\n On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit  Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the  U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended  World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzō Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the  Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  [447]\n\n  Russia  [ edit ]\n See also:  Russia–United States relations § Obama's tenure (2009–17)\n         Obama meets Russian President  Vladimir Putin in September 2015.\n After  Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014,  military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the  interference in the  2016 U.S. presidential election,  [448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.  [449]  George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.  [450]\n\n  Cultural and political image  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama\n See also:  International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election and  International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election\n Obama's family history, upbringing, and  Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement.  [451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"  [452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"  [453]\n Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.  [454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.  [455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,  [456]  [457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.  [458]\n\n         Presidential approval ratings\n According to the  Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating  [459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,  [460] a trend similar to  Ronald Reagan's and  Bill Clinton's first years in office.  [461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the  death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.  [462]  [463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.  [464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.  [465]\n Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.  [466]  [467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by  Harris Interactive for  France 24 and the   International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.  [468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  [469]  [470]\n\n         G8 leaders watching the  2012 UEFA Champions League Final\n Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album  Grammy Awards for abridged  audiobook versions of   Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for   The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.  [471] His  concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \" Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10 million times on YouTube in its first month  [472] and received a  Daytime Emmy Award.  [473] In December 2008 and in 2012,   Time magazine named Obama as its  Person of the Year.  [474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which  Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"  [475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the  UK Parliament in  Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following  Charles de Gaulle in 1960,  Nelson Mandela in 1996,  Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and  Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.  [476]  [477]\n On October 9, 2009, the  Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"  [478] Obama accepted this award in  Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"  [479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.  [480]  [481]  [482]  [483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by   The New York Times.  [484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.  [485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute,  Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.  [486]\n\n   Post-presidency (2017–present)  [ edit ]\n         Obama, with  Joe Biden and  Donald Trump at the latter's  inauguration on January 20, 2017\n Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the  inauguration of his Republican successor,  Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on  Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to  Joint Base Andrews.  [487] The family currently rents a house in  Kalorama, Washington, D.C.  [488]\n On March 2, 2017, the  John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual  Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"  [489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the  University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.  [490] On May 4, three days ahead of the  French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed  Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"  [491] Macron went on to win the election.\n While in  Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor  Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.  [492] Obama traveled to  Kensington Palace in England and met with  Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the  Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.  [493]\n After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the  Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"  [494]\n\n         Obama playing golf with the President of Argentina  Mauricio Macri, October 2017\n After Senate Republicans revealed the  Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"  [495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"  [496]\n After Attorney General  Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.  [497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents  Jimmy Carter,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush to work with  One America Appeal to help the victims of  Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Irma in the  Gulf Coast and  Texas communities.  [498]\n Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the  Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.  [499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with  Penguin Random House.  [500]\n Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President  Xi Jinping in Beijing.  [501]  [502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.  [503]  [504] He also met with the  Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.  [505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President  Emmanuel Macron, former President  Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor  Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.  [506]\n Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for  Netflix under the Obamas’ newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"  [507]  [508] Higher Ground's first film,   American Factory, won the  Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.  [509]\n A package that contained a  pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of  Donald Trump and to  CNN.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018,  Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.  [510]  [511]\n In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on  Martha's Vineyard from  Wyc Grousbeck.  [512]  [513]\n\n  Legacy  [ edit ]\n         Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to predecessors, as measured as cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term\n Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.  [514] Together with the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the  U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of  Medicare and  Medicaid in 1965.  [515]  [516]  [517]  [518]\n Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened  depression and pulling the economy back from the  Great Recession.  [514] According to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the  Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after  his first inauguration to the end of his term.  [519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the  financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to  financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the  Great Depression under Democratic President  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  [520]\n In 2009, Obama signed into law the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President  Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded  existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\n As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.  [521] In 2010, he signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \" don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from  LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.  [522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on  transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.  [523]  [234] A  Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.  [524]\n Obama substantially escalated the use of  drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with  al-Qaeda and the  Taliban.  [525]  [526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.  [527]  [528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in  Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.  [529]  [530]\n According to  Pew Research Center and  United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President  Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents  Ronald Reagan,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush.  [531]\n Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.  [532]  [533] A 2018 survey of historians by the  American Political Science Association ranked Obama the  8th-greatest American President.  [4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the  Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.

A member of the  Democratic Party, he was the first  African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a  U.S. senator from  Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an  Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\n Obama was born in  Honolulu,  Hawaii. After graduating from  Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in  Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in  Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the   Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the  University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he  represented the 13th district for three terms in the  Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he  ran for the U.S. Senate. He received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July  Democratic National Convention  keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after  his presidential campaign began, and after  close primary campaigns against  Hillary Clinton. He was  elected over  Republican  John McCain and was  inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n Regarded as a  centrist  New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the  Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the  Budget Control and the  American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in  Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia  New START treaty, and  ended military involvement in the  Iraq War. He ordered  military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of  Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in  the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni  Al-Qaeda operative  Anwar al-Awlaki.\n After winning  re-election by defeating Republican opponent  Mitt Romney, Obama was  sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for  LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to strike down  same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (  United States v. Windsor and   Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was  legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in   Obergefell. He advocated for  gun control in response to the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on  assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning  global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered  military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by  ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of  ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015  Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated  sanctions against Russia following the  invasion in Ukraine and again after  Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a  nuclear deal with Iran, and  normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated  three justices to the Supreme Court:  Sonia Sotomayor and  Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while  Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan  obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's  soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.  [2]\n Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among  the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in  Washington, D.C.  [3]  [4] A December 2019  Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.

[7]  [8]  [9] He is the only president born outside the  contiguous 48 states.  [10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother,  Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in  Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,  [11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.  [12] His father,  Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),  [13] was a married  [14]  [15]  [16]  Luo Kenyan from  Nyang'oma Kogelo.  [14]  [17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language class at the  University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.  [18]  [19] The couple married in  Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.  [20]  [21]\n In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the  University of Washington in  Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in  economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at  Harvard University, where he earned an  M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.  [22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.  [23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,  [24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.  [25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"  [19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.  [26]\n\n         Obama (right) with  his father in  Hawaii, 1971\n In 1963, Dunham met  Lolo Soetoro at the  University of Hawaii; he was an  Indonesian  East–West Center  graduate student in  geography. The couple married on  Molokai on March 15, 1965.  [27] After two one-year extensions of his  J-1 visa, Lolo returned to  Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the  Tebet sub district of  south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the  Menteng sub district of  central Jakarta.  [28]\n\n  Education  [ edit ]\n Obama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local  Indonesian-language schools:  Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and   Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language  Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.  [29]  [30] As a result of those four years in  Jakarta, he was able to speak  Indonesian fluently as a child.  [31]  [32]  [33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"  [34]\n In 1971, Obama returned to  Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn and  Stanley Dunham. He attended  Punahou School—a private  college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.  [35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"  [36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,  Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in  anthropology at the  University of Hawaii.  [37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at  Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.  [38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a  PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for  ovarian and  uterine cancer.  [39]\n Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"  [40] Obama has also written and talked about using  alcohol,  marijuana, and  cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"  [41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  [42]  [43]\n After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to  Los Angeles to attend  Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the  disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of  apartheid.  [44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in  Pakistan and  India for three weeks.  [44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to  Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in  political science with a specialty in  international relations  [45] and in  English literature  [46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.  [47] He graduated with a  BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the  Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,  [48]  [49] then as a project coordinator for the  New York Public Interest Research Group on the  City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.  [50]  [51]  [52]\n\n  Family and personal life  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Family of Barack Obama\n         Obama poses in the  Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009.\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of  his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher.\"  [53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living.  [54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,  Madelyn Dunham,  [55] until her death on November 2, 2008,  [56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in  Moneygall in May 2011.  [57] In  Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis,  President of the Confederate States of America during the  American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with  George W. Bush and  Dick Cheney, among others.  [58]  [59]  [60]\n\n         Obama with  Jonathan Toews and the  Stanley Cup champion  Chicago Blackhawks, 2010\n Obama is a supporter of the  Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the  2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.  [61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the  All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.  [62] He is also primarily a  Chicago Bears football fan in the  NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a  fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in  Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.  [63] In 2011, Obama invited the  1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their  Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the  Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  [64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,  [65] and he is left-handed.  [66]\n\n         Obama takes a left-handed  jump shot during a  pickup game on the  White House basketball court, 2009.\n Obama lived with anthropologist  Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.  [67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.  [67]  [68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  [68]\n In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin.  [69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.  [70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.  [71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent  in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.  [72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,  [73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.  [74] The Obama daughters attended the  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the  Sidwell Friends School.  [75] The Obamas have two  Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named  Bo, was a gift from Senator  Ted Kennedy.  [76] In 2013, Bo was joined by  Sunny, a female.  [77]\n\n         Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the  LBJ Presidential Library, 2014\n In 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a  Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2019) in neighboring  Kenwood, Chicago.  [78] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend  Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.  [79]\n In December 2007,   Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2019) .  [80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.  [81]  [82] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to  Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.  [83]  [84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.  [85]\n In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.  [86]  [87]\n On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in   Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a  feminist.  [88]  [89]  [90]\n\n  Religious views  [ edit ]\n Obama is a  Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.  [91] He wrote in   The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person  ... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed  atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with  black churches as a  community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"  [92]\n\n         The Obamas worship at  African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013.\n In January 2008, Obama told   Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the  redemptive death and  resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"  [93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper,  treating others as they would treat me.\"  [94]  [95]\n Obama met  Trinity United Church of Christ pastor  Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.  [96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after  some of Wright's statements were criticized.  [97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including  Shiloh Baptist Church and  St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at  Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.  [98]  [99]  [100]\n\n  Law career  [ edit ]\n  Community organizer and Harvard Law School  [ edit ]\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the  Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in  Roseland,  West Pullman, and  Riverdale on Chicago's  South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.  [51]  [101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens.  [102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.  [103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives for the first time.  [104]  [105]\n\n  External video      Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34,  Boston TV Digital Archive  [106] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.\n Despite being offered a full scholarship to  Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at  Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby  Somerville, Massachusetts.  [107] He was selected as an editor of the   Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,  [108] president of the journal in his second year,  [102]  [109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar  Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.  [110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a  summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley Austin in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.  [111] After graduating with a  JD degree   magna cum laude  [112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.  [108] Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review gained national media attention  [102]  [109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,  [113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as   Dreams from My Father.  [113]\n\n  Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney  [ edit ]\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the  University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.  [113]  [114] He then taught  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a  lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.  [115]\n From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote, a  voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading   Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.  [116]\n He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in  Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).  [117] This  class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the  Fair Housing Act.  [118] The case was settled out of court.  [119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.  [120] His law license became inactive in 2007.  [121]  [122]\n From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the  Joyce Foundation.  [51] He served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.  [51]\n\n  Legislative career  [ edit ]\n   Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama\n         State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after  ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998.\n Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator  Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park– Kenwood south to  South Shore and west to  Chicago Lawn.  [123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.  [124]  [125] He sponsored a law that increased  tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated  welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.  [126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's  payday loan regulations and  predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home  foreclosures.  [127]  [128]\n He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.  [129]  [130] In 2000, he lost a  Democratic primary race for  Illinois's 1st congressional district in the  United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.  [131]\n In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.  [132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.  [126]  [133]  [134]  [135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty reforms.  [136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.  [137]\n\n  2004 U.S. Senate campaign  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2004 United States Senate election in Illinois\n         Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue.\n In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant  David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.  [138]\n Obama was an early opponent of the  George W. Bush administration's  2003 invasion of Iraq.  [139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the  joint resolution authorizing the  Iraq War,  [140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally,  [141] and spoke out against the war.  [142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.  [143]\n Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.  [144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the  national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir,  Dreams from My Father.  [145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention,  [146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.  [147]\n Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.  [148] Six weeks later,  Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.  [149] In the  November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.  [150]\n\n   U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama\n         Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,  [151] becoming the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus.  [152]   CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would  resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.  [153]\n\n  Legislation  [ edit ]\n See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate\n Obama  cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  [154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the  Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;  [155] and the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.  [156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators  Tom Carper,  Tom Coburn, and  John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.  [157]\n Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.  [158] Regarding  tort reform, Obama voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.  [159]\n\n         Obama and U.S. Senator  Richard Lugar (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005)  [160]\n In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.  [161]  [162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.  [163]  [164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,  [165]  [166] and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.  [167]\n Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.  [168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.  [169] He sponsored the  Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the  Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;  [170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.  [171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.  [172]\n\n  Committees  [ edit ]\n         Obama speaks with a soldier stationed in Iraq, 2006.\n Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations,  Environment and Public Works and  Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.  [173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  [174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs.  [175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became  President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.

[177]  [178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic  \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.  [177]  [179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War, increasing  energy independence, and  reforming the health care system,  [180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.  [181]\n Numerous candidates entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged  delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in  caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.  [182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.  [183]\n\n         Outgoing President  George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the  Oval Office on November 10, 2008.\n On August 23, Obama announced his selection of  Delaware Senator  Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.  [184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator  Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor  Tim Kaine.  [184] At the  Democratic National Convention in  Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and  Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.  [185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at  Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.  [186]  [187]  [188]\n During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.  [189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.  [190]\n\n         2008 electoral vote results\n John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected  Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three  presidential debates in September and October 2008.  [191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365  electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.  [192] Obama won 52.9% of the  popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.  [193] He became the first African American to be elected president.  [194] Obama delivered  his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park.

[196]  [197]  [198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the  Democratic Party presidential primaries,  [199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778  convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.  [200]\n\n         2012 electoral vote results\n At the  Democratic National Convention in  Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and  Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President  Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans  Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative  Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  [201]\n On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332  electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.  [202]  [203]  [204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,  [205] Obama became the first Democratic president since  Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the  majority of the popular vote twice.  [206]  [207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's  McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"  [208]  [209]\n\n   Presidency (2009–2017)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see  Timeline of the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n See also:  Confirmations of Barack Obama's Cabinet and  List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama\n  First 100 days  [ edit ]\n Main article:  First 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency\n         Barack Obama takes  the oath of office administered by  Chief Justice  John G. Roberts Jr. at  the Capitol, January 20, 2009\n The  inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued  executive orders and  presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.  [210] He ordered the closing of the  Guantanamo Bay detention camp,  [211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds  [212]  [213]  [214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.  [215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.  [216] He also revoked President  George W. Bush's restoration of President  Ronald Reagan's  Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.  [217]\n\n  Domestic policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration\n The first bill signed into law by Obama was the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the  statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.  [218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4 million uninsured children.  [219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of  embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.  [220]\n\n         Obama delivers a  speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President  Joe Biden and  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009.\n Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated  Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring  Associate Justice  David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,  [221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of  Hispanic descent.  [222] Obama nominated  Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice  John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.  [223]\n On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a  reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the  Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  [224]  [225]\n\n         Obama meets with the  Cabinet of the United States, November 23, 2009.\n In a  major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at  NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of  human spaceflight to the moon and development of the  Ares I rocket,  Ares V rocket and  Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the  International Space Station.  [226]\n President Obama's  2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of  innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional  earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \" clean\" electricity.  [227]  [228]\n\n  LGBT rights  [ edit ]\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the  1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  [229]\n On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with  HIV, which was celebrated by  Immigration Equality.  [230]\n On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign  [231]  [232] to end the  Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the  United States Armed Forces.  [233] In 2016, the  Pentagon also ended the policy that barred  transgender people from serving openly in the military.  [234]\n As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing  same-sex marriage.  [235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.  [236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"  [237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.  [238]  [239]\n\n         The  White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.\n During his second  inaugural address on January 21, 2013,  [209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned  gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.  [240]  [241]\n In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of   Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding  same-sex marriage)  [242] and   United States v. Windsor (regarding the  Defense of Marriage Act).  [243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in   Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"  [244]\n On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the  Human Rights Campaign.  [245]\n\n  White House advisory and oversight groups  [ edit ]\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the  White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the  Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by  Executive Order  13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.  [246] The Council was chaired by  Senior Advisor to the President  Valerie Jarrett.  [247] Obama also established the  White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.  [247]  [248]  [249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President  Joe Biden and Jarrett.  [248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and  Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994  Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.  [250]\n\n  Economic policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration\n       Play media     Obama presents his first  weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion  economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the  deepening worldwide recession.  [251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and  incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.  [252]\n\n          Deficit and  debt increases, 2001–16\n In March, Obama's  Treasury Secretary,  Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the  financial crisis, including introducing the  Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.  [253]\n Obama intervened in the  troubled automotive industry  [254] in March 2009, renewing loans for  General Motors and  Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the  sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker  Fiat  [255] and a  reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.  [256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.  [257] He signed into law the  Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.  [258]  [259]  [260]\n The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the  Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.  [261] Obama and the  Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010  budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's  gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.  [262]  [263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.  [264] The most recent increase in the U.S.  debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.  [265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan  Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.  [266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a  U.S. government  default on its obligations.  [267]\n\n         US employment statistics ( unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama's tenure as U.S. President  [268]  [269]\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.  [270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.  [271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,  [272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.  [273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.  [274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.  [275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.  [275] In July 2010, the  Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman  Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"  [276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.  [277]\n The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.  [278]  [279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,  [279]  [280]  [281]  [282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"  [278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the  National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.  [283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original  NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of  World War II.  [284] The  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.  [285]\n Within a month of the  2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the  2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year  payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for  estate taxes.  [286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.  [287]\n In December 2013, Obama declared that growing  income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the  nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and  Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and  trickle-down economics.  [288]\n Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.  [289]\n\n  Environmental policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Climate change policy of the United States\n         Obama at a 2010 briefing on the  BP oil spill at the  Coast Guard Station Venice in  Venice, Louisiana\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb  global warming.  [290]  [291]\n On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore  drilling rig at the  Macondo Prospect in the  Gulf of Mexico, causing a  major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by  Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new  deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.  [292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.  [293]\n In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the  Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"  [294]  [295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to  petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.  [296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.  [297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.  [298]\n Obama emphasized the  conservation of  federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the  Antiquities Act to create 25 new  national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.  [299]  [300]  [301]  [302]\n\n  Health care reform  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Health care reform in the United States\n         Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010.\n Obama called for  Congress to pass legislation reforming  health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.  [303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the  public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for  pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.  [304]  [305]\n\n         Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and  federal poverty level, under  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:  CRS)  [306]\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.  [303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered  a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.  [307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.  [308]\n On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.  [309]  [310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.  [311] On March 21, 2010, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.  [312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.  [313]\n The ACA includes  health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding  Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the  federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,  [314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,  [315]  [316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing  health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  [315]  [317]\n\n         Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source:  JAMA)  [318]\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income  brackets, taxes on  indoor tanning, cuts to the  Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;  [319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.  [320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.  [321]\n The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in   National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.  [322] In   Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in   King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.  [323]\n\n  Energy policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Energy policy of the Obama administration\n Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic  energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his  State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.  [324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.  [325]  [326]\n\n  Gun control  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy\n         Obama visits an  Aurora shooting victim at  University of Colorado Hospital, 2012.\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding  gun control.  [327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an  expired ban on military-style  assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.  [328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.  [329] In a 2016 editorial in the  New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to  women's suffrage and other  civil rights movements in American history.  [330]\n\n  2010 midterm elections  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2010 United States House of Representatives elections and  2010 United States Senate elections\n Obama called the  November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,  [331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"  [332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.  [333]\n\n  Cybersecurity and Internet policy  [ edit ]\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the  Federal Communications Commission reclassify  broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve  net neutrality.  [334]  [335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed  Executive Order  13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"  [336]\n\n  Government mass surveillance  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama on mass surveillance\n In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the  Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.  [337]  [338]  [339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.  [339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.  [340] Following the  2013 global surveillance disclosures by  whistleblower  Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,  [338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.  [341]  [342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.  [343]\n\n  Foreign policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration\n         June 4, 2009 − after his speech   A New Beginning at  Cairo University, U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others  Jamal Khashoggi,  Bambang Harymurti and  Nahum Barnea.\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \" reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.  [344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network,  Al Arabiya.  [345]\n On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.  [346]  [347] In April, Obama gave a speech in  Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.  [348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at  Cairo University in Egypt calling for \" A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.  [349]\n\n          International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office\n         Obama with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in 2011\n On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following  Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"  [350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"  [351]\n On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to  preside over a meeting of the  United Nations Security Council.  [352]\n In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of  East Jerusalem.  [353]  [354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev to replace the  1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.  [355] Obama and Medvedev signed the  New START treaty in April 2010, and the  U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.  [356]\n\n         Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister  Matteo Renzi at the  White House, October 2016.\n In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider  LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.  [357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,  [358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming  2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, Russia.  [359]\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to  normalize relationships between  Cuba and the United States.  [360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\n In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their  military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.  [361]  [362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of  arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.  [363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to  Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes  targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.  [364]\n Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor  Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.  [365]\n\n  War in Iraq  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  Iraq War and  American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of  Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"  [366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to  counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.  [367]  [368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.  [369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"  [370]\n\n         Meeting with UK Prime Minister  David Cameron during the  2010 G20 Toronto summit\n In June 2014, following the  capture of Mosul by  ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit  widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.  [371]  [372]\n In August 2014, during the  Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a  campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.  [373]\n By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict  [374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.  [375]\n In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the  82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,  [376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.  [377]\n\n  War in Afghanistan  [ edit ]\n Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001–present)\n Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.  [378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"  [379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General  David D. McKiernan, with former  Special Forces commander Lt. Gen.  Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.  [380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;  [381] this took place in July 2011.  David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.  [382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.  [383]\n In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.  [384]\n\n  Israel  [ edit ]\n         Obama meeting with Israeli President  Shimon Peres in the  Oval Office, May 2009\n In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning  Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.  [385] Obama supports the  two-state solution to the  Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.  [386]\n In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"  [387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the  U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.  [388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the  Iron Dome program in response to the waves of  Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.  [389]\n In 2013,  Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"  [390] In 2014, Obama likened the  Zionist movement to the  Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"  [391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the  2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.  [392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the  Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"  [393]\n On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned  Israeli settlement building in the occupied  Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.  [394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,  [395]  [396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.  [397] On January 5, 2017, the  United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.  [398]  [399]\n\n  Libya  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2011 military intervention in Libya\n         President Obama meets with Russian President  Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015.\n In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator  Muammar Gaddafi as part of the  Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the  Arab League, and a resolution  [400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.  [401] In response to the unanimous passage of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi  [402]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,  [403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling  Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,  [404] including the use of  Tomahawk missiles,  B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.  [405]  [406]  [407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members,  NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed  Operation Unified Protector.  [408] Some Representatives  [409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.  [410]  [411]\n\n  Syrian Civil War  [ edit ]\n See also:  Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the  Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for  President Assad to step aside.\"  [412]  [413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.  [414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple  programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.  [415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.  [416]  [417]\n In the wake of a  chemical weapons attack in Syria,  formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged  [418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad  giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with  chlorine gas continued.  [419]  [420] In 2014, Obama authorized an  air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.  [421]  [422]\n\n  Death of Osama bin Laden  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Death of Osama bin Laden\n       Play media     President Obama's address (9:28)   Also available:  Audio only;  Full text   \n         Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on  Operation Neptune's Spear in the  White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011. See also:   Situation Room\n Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of  Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in  a large compound in  Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from  Islamabad.  [423] CIA head  Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.  [423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by  United States Navy SEALs.  [423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.  [424]  [425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,  [426] which was buried at sea several hours later.  [427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's  Ground Zero and  Times Square.  [424]  [428]  Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  [429]\n\n \n  Iran nuclear talks  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n         Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013.\n In November 2013, the Obama administration opened  negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring  nuclear weapons, which included an  interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \" Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.  [430]  [431]  [432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"  [433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded  Hezbollah from the  Drug Enforcement Administration's  Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the  Central Intelligence Agency.  [434]  [435]\n\n  Relations with Cuba  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States–Cuban Thaw\n         President Obama meeting with Cuban President  Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015\n Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and  Vatican City.  [436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when  Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to  exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.  [437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President  Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the  Nelson Mandela memorial service in  Johannesburg.  [438]\n In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with  Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.  [439] Popularly dubbed the  Cuban Thaw,   The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"  [440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and  Havana.  [441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.  [442]\n Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since  Calvin Coolidge in 1928.  [443]\n\n  Africa  [ edit ]\n Obama spoke in front of the  African Union in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in  education, infrastructure, and  economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities ( LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified  democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.  [444]  [445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to  visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.  [446]\n\n  Hiroshima speech  [ edit ]\n On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit  Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the  U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended  World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzō Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the  Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  [447]\n\n  Russia  [ edit ]\n See also:  Russia–United States relations § Obama's tenure (2009–17)\n         Obama meets Russian President  Vladimir Putin in September 2015.\n After  Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014,  military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the  interference in the  2016 U.S. presidential election,  [448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.  [449]  George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.  [450]\n\n  Cultural and political image  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama\n See also:  International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election and  International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election\n Obama's family history, upbringing, and  Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement.  [451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"  [452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"  [453]\n Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.  [454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.  [455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,  [456]  [457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.  [458]\n\n         Presidential approval ratings\n According to the  Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating  [459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,  [460] a trend similar to  Ronald Reagan's and  Bill Clinton's first years in office.  [461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the  death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.  [462]  [463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.  [464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.  [465]\n Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.  [466]  [467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by  Harris Interactive for  France 24 and the   International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.  [468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  [469]  [470]\n\n         G8 leaders watching the  2012 UEFA Champions League Final\n Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album  Grammy Awards for abridged  audiobook versions of   Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for   The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.  [471] His  concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \" Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10 million times on YouTube in its first month  [472] and received a  Daytime Emmy Award.  [473] In December 2008 and in 2012,   Time magazine named Obama as its  Person of the Year.  [474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which  Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"  [475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the  UK Parliament in  Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following  Charles de Gaulle in 1960,  Nelson Mandela in 1996,  Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and  Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.  [476]  [477]\n On October 9, 2009, the  Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"  [478] Obama accepted this award in  Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"  [479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.  [480]  [481]  [482]  [483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by   The New York Times.  [484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.  [485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute,  Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.  [486]\n\n   Post-presidency (2017–present)  [ edit ]\n         Obama, with  Joe Biden and  Donald Trump at the latter's  inauguration on January 20, 2017\n Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the  inauguration of his Republican successor,  Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on  Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to  Joint Base Andrews.  [487] The family currently rents a house in  Kalorama, Washington, D.C.  [488]\n On March 2, 2017, the  John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual  Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"  [489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the  University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.  [490] On May 4, three days ahead of the  French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed  Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"  [491] Macron went on to win the election.\n While in  Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor  Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.  [492] Obama traveled to  Kensington Palace in England and met with  Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the  Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.  [493]\n After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the  Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"  [494]\n\n         Obama playing golf with the President of Argentina  Mauricio Macri, October 2017\n After Senate Republicans revealed the  Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"  [495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"  [496]\n After Attorney General  Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.  [497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents  Jimmy Carter,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush to work with  One America Appeal to help the victims of  Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Irma in the  Gulf Coast and  Texas communities.  [498]\n Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the  Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.  [499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with  Penguin Random House.  [500]\n Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President  Xi Jinping in Beijing.  [501]  [502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.  [503]  [504] He also met with the  Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.  [505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President  Emmanuel Macron, former President  Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor  Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.  [506]\n Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for  Netflix under the Obamas’ newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"  [507]  [508] Higher Ground's first film,   American Factory, won the  Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.  [509]\n A package that contained a  pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of  Donald Trump and to  CNN.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018,  Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.  [510]  [511]\n In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on  Martha's Vineyard from  Wyc Grousbeck.  [512]  [513]\n\n  Legacy  [ edit ]\n         Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to predecessors, as measured as cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term\n Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.  [514] Together with the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the  U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of  Medicare and  Medicaid in 1965.  [515]  [516]  [517]  [518]\n Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened  depression and pulling the economy back from the  Great Recession.  [514] According to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the  Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after  his first inauguration to the end of his term.  [519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the  financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to  financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the  Great Depression under Democratic President  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  [520]\n In 2009, Obama signed into law the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President  Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded  existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\n As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.  [521] In 2010, he signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \" don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from  LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.  [522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on  transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.  [523]  [234] A  Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.  [524]\n Obama substantially escalated the use of  drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with  al-Qaeda and the  Taliban.  [525]  [526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.  [527]  [528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in  Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.  [529]  [530]\n According to  Pew Research Center and  United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President  Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents  Ronald Reagan,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush.  [531]\n Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.  [532]  [533] A 2018 survey of historians by the  American Political Science Association ranked Obama the  8th-greatest American President.  [4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the  Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.  [534]\n\n  Presidential library  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama Presidential Center\n The Barack Obama Presidential Center is Obama's planned  presidential library.

A member of the  Democratic Party, he was the first  African-American president of the United States. He previously served as a  U.S. senator from  Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an  Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.\n Obama was born in  Honolulu,  Hawaii. After graduating from  Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in  Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in  Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the   Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the  University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he  represented the 13th district for three terms in the  Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he  ran for the U.S. Senate. He received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate-primary win, his well-received July  Democratic National Convention  keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after  his campaign began, after  a close primary campaign against  Hillary Clinton. He was  elected over  Republican  John McCain and was  inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n Regarded as a  centrist  New Democrat, Obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms that were passed include the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly referred to as the \"Affordable Care Act\" or \"Obamacare\"), the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the  Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the  Budget Control and the  American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in  Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia  New START treaty, and  ended military involvement in the  Iraq War. He ordered  military involvement in Libya, contributing to the overthrow of  Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in  the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni  Al-Qaeda operative  Anwar al-Awlaki.\n After winning  re-election by defeating Republican opponent  Mitt Romney, Obama was  sworn in for a second term in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for  LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to strike down  same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (  United States v. Windsor and   Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was  legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in   Obergefell. He advocated for  gun control in response to the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on  assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning  global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered  military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by  ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of  ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015  Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated  sanctions against Russia following the  invasion in Ukraine and again after  Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a  nuclear deal with Iran, and  normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated  three justices to the Supreme Court:  Sonia Sotomayor and  Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while  Merrick Garland faced unprecedented partisan  obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. During his term in office, America's  soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.  [2]\n Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among  the upper tier of American presidents. Obama left office and retired in January 2017 and currently resides in  Washington, D.C.  [3]  [4] A December 2019  Gallup poll found that Obama was the most admired man in America for a record 12th consecutive year.

[7]  [8]  [9] He is the only president born outside the  contiguous 48 states.  [10] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother,  Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in  Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,  [11] with some German, Irish, Scottish, Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.  [12] His father,  Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),  [13] was a married  [14]  [15]  [16]  Luo Kenyan from  Nyang'oma Kogelo.  [14]  [17] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a  Russian language class at the  University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.  [18]  [19] The couple married in  Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.  [20]  [21]\n In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the  University of Washington in  Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in  economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at  Harvard University, where he earned an  M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.  [22] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.  [23] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,  [24] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.  [25] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"  [19] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.  [26]\n\n         Obama (right) with  his father in  Hawaii, 1971\n In 1963, Dunham met  Lolo Soetoro at the  University of Hawaii; he was an  Indonesian  East–West Center  graduate student in  geography. The couple married on  Molokai on March 15, 1965.  [27] After two one-year extensions of his  J-1 visa, Lolo returned to  Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the  Tebet sub district of  south Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the  Menteng sub district of  central Jakarta.  [28]\n\n  Education  [ edit ]\n Obama started in St. Francis Pre-Education from age three to five. From age six to ten, he then attended local  Indonesian-language schools:  Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and   Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language  Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.  [29]  [30] As a result of those four years in  Jakarta, he was able to speak  Indonesian fluently as a child.  [31]  [32]  [33] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"  [34]\n In 1971, Obama returned to  Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents,  Madelyn and  Stanley Dunham. He attended  Punahou School—a private  college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.  [35] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"  [36] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister,  Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in  anthropology at the  University of Hawaii.  [37] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at  Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work.  [38] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a  PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for  ovarian and  uterine cancer.  [39]\n Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered—to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect—became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"  [40] Obama has also written and talked about using  alcohol,  marijuana, and  cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"  [41] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang,\" a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.  [42]  [43]\n After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to  Los Angeles to attend  Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the  disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of  apartheid.  [44] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in  Pakistan and  India for three weeks.  [44] Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to  Columbia College, Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in  political science with a specialty in  international relations  [45] and in  English literature  [46] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.  [47] He graduated with a  BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the  Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,  [48]  [49] then as a project coordinator for the  New York Public Interest Research Group on the  City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.  [50]  [51]  [52]\n\n  Family and personal life  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Family of Barack Obama\n         Obama poses in the  Green Room of the White House with wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia, 2009.\n In a 2006 interview, Obama highlighted the diversity of  his extended family: \"It's like a little mini-United Nations,\" he said. \"I've got relatives who look like  Bernie Mac, and I've got relatives who look like  Margaret Thatcher.\"  [53] Obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (Maya Soetoro-Ng) and seven other half-siblings from his Kenyan father's family—six of them living.  [54] Obama's mother was survived by her Kansas-born mother,  Madelyn Dunham,  [55] until her death on November 2, 2008,  [56] two days before his election to the Presidency. Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in  Moneygall in May 2011.  [57] In  Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of  Jefferson Davis,  President of the Confederate States of America during the  American Civil War. He also shares distant ancestors in common with  George W. Bush and  Dick Cheney, among others.  [58]  [59]  [60]\n\n         Obama with  Jonathan Toews and the  Stanley Cup champion  Chicago Blackhawks, 2010\n Obama is a supporter of the  Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the  2005 ALCS when he was still a senator.  [61] In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the  All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket.  [62] He is also primarily a  Chicago Bears football fan in the  NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a  fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in  Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as president.  [63] In 2011, Obama invited the  1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their  Super Bowl win in 1986 due to the  Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.  [64] He plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team,  [65] and he is left-handed.  [66]\n\n         Obama takes a left-handed  jump shot during a  pickup game on the  White House basketball court, 2009.\n Obama lived with anthropologist  Sheila Miyoshi Jager while he was a community organizer in Chicago in the 1980s.  [67] He proposed to her twice, but both Jager and her parents turned him down.  [67]  [68] The relationship was not made public until May 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.  [68]\n In June 1989, Obama met  Michelle Robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the Chicago law firm of  Sidley Austin.  [69] Robinson was assigned for three months as Obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date.  [70] They began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on October 3, 1992.  [71] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent  in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children.  [72] The couple's first daughter, Malia Ann, was born in 1998,  [73] followed by a second daughter, Natasha (\"Sasha\"), in 2001.  [74] The Obama daughters attended the  University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the  Sidwell Friends School.  [75] The Obamas have two  Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named  Bo, was a gift from Senator  Ted Kennedy.  [76] In 2013, Bo was joined by  Sunny, a female.  [77]\n\n         Obama and his wife Michelle at the Civil Rights Summit at the  LBJ Presidential Library, 2014\n In 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a  Hyde Park, Chicago condominium to a $1.6 million house (equivalent to $2.1 million in 2019) in neighboring  Kenwood, Chicago.  [78] The purchase of an adjacent lot—and sale of part of it to Obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend  Tony Rezko—attracted media attention because of Rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to Obama.  [79]\n In December 2007,   Money Magazine estimated Obama's net worth at $1.3 million (equivalent to $1.6 million in 2019) .  [80] Their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5 million—up from about $4.2 million in 2007 and $1.6 million in 2005—mostly from sales of his books.  [81]  [82] On his 2010 income of $1.7 million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to  Fisher House Foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments.  [83]  [84] Per his 2012 financial disclosure, Obama may be worth as much as $10 million.  [85]\n In early 2010, Michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said Barack had quit smoking.  [86]  [87]\n On his 55th birthday, August 4, 2016, Obama penned an essay in   Glamour, in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a  feminist.  [88]  [89]  [90]\n\n  Religious views  [ edit ]\n Obama is a  Protestant Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.  [91] He wrote in   The Audacity of Hope that he \"was not raised in a religious household.\" He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet \"in many ways the most spiritually awakened person  ... I have ever known.\" He described his father as a \"confirmed  atheist\" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as \"a man who saw religion as not particularly useful.\" Obama explained how, through working with  black churches as a  community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand \"the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change.\"  [92]\n\n         The Obamas worship at  African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., January 2013.\n In January 2008, Obama told   Christianity Today: \"I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the  redemptive death and  resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.\"  [93] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, \"I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper,  treating others as they would treat me.\"  [94]  [95]\n Obama met  Trinity United Church of Christ pastor  Jeremiah Wright in October 1987 and became a member of Trinity in 1992.  [96] During Obama's first presidential campaign in May 2008, he resigned from Trinity after  some of Wright's statements were criticized.  [97] Since moving to Washington, D.C., in 2009, the Obama family has attended several Protestant churches, including  Shiloh Baptist Church and  St. John's Episcopal Church, as well as Evergreen Chapel at  Camp David, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.  [98]  [99]  [100]\n\n  Law career  [ edit ]\n  Community organizer and Harvard Law School  [ edit ]\n Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when he was hired as director of the  Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in  Roseland,  West Pullman, and  Riverdale on Chicago's  South Side. He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.  [51]  [101] He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in  Altgeld Gardens.  [102] Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the  Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute.  [103] In mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his  paternal relatives for the first time.  [104]  [105]\n\n  External video      Derrick Bell threatens to leave Harvard, April 24, 1990, 11:34,  Boston TV Digital Archive  [106] Student Barack Obama introduces Professor Derrick Bell starting at 6:25.\n Despite being offered a full scholarship to  Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at  Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby  Somerville, Massachusetts.  [107] He was selected as an editor of the   Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,  [108] president of the journal in his second year,  [102]  [109] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar  Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years.  [110] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a  summer associate at the law firms of  Sidley Austin in 1989 and  Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.  [111] After graduating with a  JD degree   magna cum laude  [112] from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.  [108] Obama's election as the  first black president of the  Harvard Law Review gained national media attention  [102]  [109] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,  [113] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as   Dreams from My Father.  [113]\n\n  Chicago Law School and civil rights attorney  [ edit ]\n In 1991, Obama accepted a two-year position as Visiting Law and Government Fellow at the  University of Chicago Law School to work on his first book.  [113]  [114] He then taught  constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, first as a  lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.  [115]\n From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's  Project Vote, a  voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading   Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of \"40 under Forty\" powers to be.  [116]\n He joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill & Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an  associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then  of counsel from 1996 to 2004. In 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in  Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 94 C 4094 (N.D. Ill.).  [117] This  class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with Selma Buycks-Roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that Citibank Federal Savings Bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the  Fair Housing Act.  [118] The case was settled out of court.  [119] Final judgment was issued on May 13, 1998, with Citibank Federal Savings Bank agreeing to pay attorney fees.  [120] His law license became inactive in 2007.  [121]  [122]\n From 1994 to 2002, Obama served on the boards of directors of the  Woods Fund of Chicago—which in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the Developing Communities Project—and of the  Joyce Foundation.  [51] He served on the board of directors of the  Chicago Annenberg Challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.  [51]\n\n  Legislative career  [ edit ]\n   Illinois State Senator (1997–2004)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama\n         State Senator Obama and others celebrate the naming of a street in Chicago after  ShoreBank co-founder Milton Davis in 1998.\n Obama was elected to the  Illinois Senate in 1996, succeeding Democratic State Senator  Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from  Hyde Park– Kenwood south to  South Shore and west to  Chicago Lawn.  [123] Once elected, Obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws.  [124]  [125] He sponsored a law that increased  tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated  welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare.  [126] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's  payday loan regulations and  predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home  foreclosures.  [127]  [128]\n He was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.  [129]  [130] In 2000, he lost a  Democratic primary race for  Illinois's 1st congressional district in the  United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent  Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.  [131]\n In January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate's Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.  [132] He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor  racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.  [126]  [133]  [134]  [135] During his 2004 general election campaign for the U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting  death penalty reforms.  [136] Obama resigned from the Illinois Senate in November 2004 following his election to the U.S. Senate.  [137]\n\n  2004 U.S. Senate campaign  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2004 United States Senate election in Illinois\n         Results of the 2004 U.S. Senate race in Illinois; Obama won the counties in blue.\n In May 2002, Obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 U.S. Senate race. He created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant  David Axelrod by August 2002. Obama formally announced his candidacy in January 2003.  [138]\n Obama was an early opponent of the  George W. Bush administration's  2003 invasion of Iraq.  [139] On October 2, 2002, the day President Bush and Congress agreed on the  joint resolution authorizing the  Iraq War,  [140] Obama addressed the first high-profile Chicago  anti-Iraq War rally,  [141] and spoke out against the war.  [142] He addressed another anti-war rally in March 2003 and told the crowd \"it's not too late\" to stop the war.  [143]\n Decisions by Republican incumbent  Peter Fitzgerald and his Democratic predecessor  Carol Moseley Braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open Democratic and Republican primary contests involving 15 candidates.  [144] In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the  national Democratic Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir,  Dreams from My Father.  [145] In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the  2004 Democratic National Convention,  [146] seen by nine million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the Democratic Party.  [147]\n Obama's expected opponent in the general election, Republican primary winner  Jack Ryan, withdrew from the race in June 2004.  [148] Six weeks later,  Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.  [149] In the  November 2004 general election, Obama won with 70% of the vote.  [150]\n\n   U.S. Senator from Illinois (2005–08)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States Senate career of Barack Obama\n         Official portrait of Obama as a member of the United States Senate\n Obama was sworn in as a senator on January 3, 2005,  [151] becoming the only Senate member of the  Congressional Black Caucus.  [152]   CQ Weekly characterized him as a \"loyal Democrat\" based on analysis of all Senate votes from 2005 to 2007. Obama announced on November 13, 2008, that he would  resign his Senate seat on November 16, 2008, before the start of the  lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.  [153]\n\n  Legislation  [ edit ]\n See also:  List of bills sponsored by Barack Obama in the United States Senate\n Obama  cosponsored the  Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.  [154] He introduced two initiatives that bore his name: Lugar–Obama, which expanded the  Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction concept to conventional weapons;  [155] and the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of USAspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending.  [156] On June 3, 2008, Senator Obama—along with Senators  Tom Carper,  Tom Coburn, and  John McCain—introduced follow-up legislation: Strengthening Transparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008.  [157]\n Obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full Senate after being heavily modified in committee.  [158] Regarding  tort reform, Obama voted for the  Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 and the  FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with  NSA warrantless wiretapping operations.  [159]\n\n         Obama and U.S. Senator  Richard Lugar (R-IN) visit a Russian facility for dismantling mobile missiles (August 2005)  [160]\n In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the  Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor.  [161]  [162] In January 2007, Obama and Senator Feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the  Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which was signed into law in September 2007.  [163]  [164] Obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the  Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections,  [165]  [166] and the  Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007.  [167]\n Later in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges.  [168] This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008.  [169] He sponsored the  Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the  Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010;  [170] and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.  [171] Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the  State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.  [172]\n\n  Committees  [ edit ]\n         Obama speaks with a soldier stationed in Iraq, 2006.\n Obama held assignments on the Senate Committees for  Foreign Relations,  Environment and Public Works and  Veterans' Affairs through December 2006.  [173] In January 2007, he left the Environment and Public Works committee and took additional assignments with  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  [174] He also became Chairman of the Senate's subcommittee on  European Affairs.  [175] As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Obama made official trips to Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. He met with  Mahmoud Abbas before Abbas became  President of the Palestinian National Authority, and gave a speech at the  University of Nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the Kenyan government.  [176]\n\n  Presidential campaigns  [ edit ]\n  2008  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2008 United States presidential election,  Barack Obama 2008 presidential primary campaign, and  Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign\n         Obama on stage with his wife and daughters just before announcing his presidential candidacy in  Springfield, Illinois, February 10, 2007\n On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the  Old State Capitol building in  Springfield, Illinois.  [177]  [178] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where  Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic  \"House Divided\" speech in 1858.  [177]  [179] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the  Iraq War, increasing  energy independence, and  reforming the health care system,  [180] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.  [181]\n Numerous candidates entered the  Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to a duel between Obama and Senator  Hillary Clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged  delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in  caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules.  [182] On June 7, 2008, Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.  [183]\n\n         Outgoing President  George W. Bush meets with President-elect Obama in the  Oval Office on November 10, 2008.\n On August 23, Obama announced his selection of  Delaware Senator  Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate.  [184] Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator  Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor  Tim Kaine.  [184] At the  Democratic National Convention in  Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, and she and  Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support.  [185] Obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at  Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide.  [186]  [187]  [188]\n During both the primary process and the general election, Obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations.  [189] On June 19, 2008, Obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down  public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.  [190]\n\n         2008 electoral vote results\n John McCain was nominated as the Republican candidate, and he selected  Sarah Palin as his running mate. The two candidates engaged in three  presidential debates in September and October 2008.  [191] On November 4, Obama won the presidency with 365  electoral votes to 173 received by McCain.  [192] Obama won 52.9% of the  popular vote to McCain's 45.7%.  [193] He became the first African American to be elected president.  [194] Obama delivered  his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in Chicago's  Grant Park.  [195]\n\n  2012  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2012 United States presidential election and  Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign\n         Obama greets former Governor  Mitt Romney in the  Oval Office on November 29, 2012, in their first meeting since Obama's re-election victory over Romney.\n On April 4, 2011, Obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled \"It Begins with Us\" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the  Federal Election Commission.  [196]  [197]  [198] As the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the  Democratic Party presidential primaries,  [199] and on April 3, 2012, Obama had secured the 2778  convention delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.  [200]\n\n         2012 electoral vote results\n At the  Democratic National Convention in  Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and  Joe Biden were formally nominated by former President  Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans  Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative  Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  [201]\n On November 6, 2012, Obama won 332  electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president.  [202]  [203]  [204] With 51.1% of the popular vote,  [205] Obama became the first Democratic president since  Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the  majority of the popular vote twice.  [206]  [207] Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's  McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"  [208]  [209]\n\n   Presidency (2009–2017)  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Presidency of Barack Obama\n For a chronological guide to this subject, see  Timeline of the Presidency of Barack Obama.\n See also:  Confirmations of Barack Obama's Cabinet and  List of international presidential trips made by Barack Obama\n  First 100 days  [ edit ]\n Main article:  First 100 days of Barack Obama's presidency\n         Barack Obama takes  the oath of office administered by  Chief Justice  John G. Roberts Jr. at  the Capitol, January 20, 2009\n The  inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th President took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued  executive orders and  presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.  [210] He ordered the closing of the  Guantanamo Bay detention camp,  [211] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds  [212]  [213]  [214] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.  [215] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.  [216] He also revoked President  George W. Bush's restoration of President  Ronald Reagan's  Mexico City Policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.  [217]\n\n  Domestic policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration\n The first bill signed into law by Obama was the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, relaxing the  statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits.  [218] Five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the  State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) to cover an additional 4 million uninsured children.  [219] In March 2009, Obama reversed a Bush-era policy that had limited funding of  embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop \"strict guidelines\" on the research.  [220]\n\n         Obama delivers a  speech at joint session of Congress with Vice President  Joe Biden and  House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi on February 24, 2009.\n Obama appointed two women to serve on the Supreme Court in the first two years of his Presidency. He nominated  Sonia Sotomayor on May 26, 2009 to replace retiring  Associate Justice  David Souter; she was confirmed on August 6, 2009,  [221] becoming the first Supreme Court Justice of  Hispanic descent.  [222] Obama nominated  Elena Kagan on May 10, 2010 to replace retiring Associate Justice  John Paul Stevens. She was confirmed on August 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the Court to three justices for the first time in American history.  [223]\n On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, a  reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the  Pell Grant scholarship award, and made changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  [224]  [225]\n\n         Obama meets with the  Cabinet of the United States, November 23, 2009.\n In a  major space policy speech in April 2010, Obama announced a planned change in direction at  NASA, the U.S. space agency. He ended plans for a return of  human spaceflight to the moon and development of the  Ares I rocket,  Ares V rocket and  Constellation program, in favor of funding Earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to Mars, and ongoing missions to the  International Space Station.  [226]\n President Obama's  2011 State of the Union Address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of  innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally. He spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, banning congressional  earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. He promised the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on \" clean\" electricity.  [227]  [228]\n\n  LGBT rights  [ edit ]\n On October 8, 2009, Obama signed the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a measure that expanded the  1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.  [229]\n On October 30, 2009, Obama lifted the ban on travel to the United States by those infected with  HIV, which was celebrated by  Immigration Equality.  [230]\n On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign  [231]  [232] to end the  Don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the  United States Armed Forces.  [233] In 2016, the  Pentagon also ended the policy that barred  transgender people from serving openly in the military.  [234]\n As a candidate for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said he favored legalizing  same-sex marriage.  [235] By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages.  [236] In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"  [237] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.  [238]  [239]\n\n         The  White House was illuminated in rainbow colors on the evening of the Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, June 26, 2015.\n During his second  inaugural address on January 21, 2013,  [209] Obama became the first U.S. President in office to call for full equality for gay Americans: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" This was the first time that a president mentioned  gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.  [240]  [241]\n In 2013, the Obama Administration filed briefs that urged the  Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of   Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding  same-sex marriage)  [242] and   United States v. Windsor (regarding the  Defense of Marriage Act).  [243] Then, following the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in   Obergefell v. Hodges (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), Obama asserted that, \"This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free.\"  [244]\n On July 30, 2015, the White House Office of National AIDS Policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the  Human Rights Campaign.  [245]\n\n  White House advisory and oversight groups  [ edit ]\n On March 11, 2009, Obama created the  White House Council on Women and Girls, which formed part of the  Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, having been established by  Executive Order  13506 with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of American women and girls.  [246] The Council was chaired by  Senior Advisor to the President  Valerie Jarrett.  [247] Obama also established the  White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States.  [247]  [248]  [249] The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President  Joe Biden and Jarrett.  [248] The Task Force was a development out of the White House Council on Women and Girls and  Office of the Vice President of the United States, and prior to that the 1994  Violence Against Women Act first drafted by Biden.  [250]\n\n  Economic policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Economic policy of the Barack Obama administration\n       Play media     Obama presents his first  weekly address as President of the United States on January 24, 2009, discussing the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\n On February 17, 2009, Obama signed the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion  economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the  deepening worldwide recession.  [251] The act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and  incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.  [252]\n\n          Deficit and  debt increases, 2001–16\n In March, Obama's  Treasury Secretary,  Timothy Geithner, took further steps to manage the  financial crisis, including introducing the  Public–Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, which contains provisions for buying up to two trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.  [253]\n Obama intervened in the  troubled automotive industry  [254] in March 2009, renewing loans for  General Motors and  Chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the  sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker  Fiat  [255] and a  reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the Canadian government taking a 12% stake.  [256] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.  [257] He signed into law the  Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers,\" which temporarily boosted the economy.  [258]  [259]  [260]\n The Bush and Obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the  Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. These guarantees totaled about $11.5 trillion, but only $3 trillion had been spent by the end of November 2009.  [261] Obama and the  Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010  budget deficit would be $1.5 trillion or 10.6% of the nation's  gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4 trillion or 9.9% of GDP.  [262]  [263] For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34 trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53 trillion or 90% of GDP.  [264] The most recent increase in the U.S.  debt ceiling to $17.2 trillion took effect in February 2014.  [265] On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan  Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.  [266] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a  U.S. government  default on its obligations.  [267]\n\n         US employment statistics ( unemployment rate and monthly changes in net employment) during Obama's tenure as U.S. President  [268]  [269]\n As it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in October at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. Following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year.  [270] Between February and December 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries.  [271] By November 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%,  [272] decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013.  [273] During 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter.  [274] GDP growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter.  [275] Growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year.  [275] In July 2010, the  Federal Reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman  Ben Bernanke said the economic outlook was \"unusually uncertain.\"  [276] Overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.  [277]\n The  Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and a broad range of economists credit Obama's stimulus plan for economic growth.  [278]  [279] The CBO released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1–2.1 million,  [279]  [280]  [281]  [282] while conceding that \"It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package.\"  [278] Although an April 2010, survey of members of the  National Association for Business Economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar January survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment.  [283] The economy of the United States has grown faster than the other original  NATO members by a wider margin under President Obama than it has anytime since the end of  World War II.  [284] The  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development credits the much faster growth in the United States to the stimulus plan of the US and the austerity measures in the European Union.  [285]\n Within a month of the  2010 midterm elections, Obama announced a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the  2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year  payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for  estate taxes.  [286] The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858 billion  Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.  [287]\n In December 2013, Obama declared that growing  income inequality is a \"defining challenge of our time\" and called on Congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. This came on the heels of the  nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and  Pope Francis' criticism of inequality and  trickle-down economics.  [288]\n Obama urged Congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the  Trans-Pacific Partnership.  [289]\n\n  Environmental policy  [ edit ]\n See also:  Climate change policy of the United States\n         Obama at a 2010 briefing on the  BP oil spill at the  Coast Guard Station Venice in  Venice, Louisiana\n On September 30, 2009, the Obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb  global warming.  [290]  [291]\n On April 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore  drilling rig at the  Macondo Prospect in the  Gulf of Mexico, causing a  major sustained oil leak. Obama visited the Gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by  Secretary of the Interior  Ken Salazar and concurrent Congressional hearings. He then announced a six-month moratorium on new  deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.  [292] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.  [293]\n In July 2013, Obama expressed reservations and said he \"would reject the  Keystone XL pipeline if it increased carbon pollution\" or \"greenhouse emissions.\"  [294]  [295] Obama's advisers called for a halt to  petroleum exploration in the Arctic in January 2013.  [296] On February 24, 2015, Obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline.  [297] It was the third veto of Obama's presidency and his first major veto.  [298]\n Obama emphasized the  conservation of  federal lands during his term in office. He used his power under the  Antiquities Act to create 25 new  national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of 553,000,000 acres (224,000,000 ha) of federal lands and waters, more than any other U.S. president.  [299]  [300]  [301]  [302]\n\n  Health care reform  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Health care reform in the United States\n         Obama signs the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at the White House, March 23, 2010.\n Obama called for  Congress to pass legislation reforming  health care in the United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.  [303] He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900 billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the  public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for  pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.  [304]  [305]\n\n         Maximum Out-of-Pocket Premium as Percentage of Family Income and  federal poverty level, under  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, starting in 2014 (Source:  CRS)  [306]\n On July 14, 2009, House Democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the U.S. health care system, which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009.  [303] After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009, Obama delivered  a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals.  [307] In March 2009, Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.  [308]\n On November 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House.  [309]  [310] On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed its own bill—without a public option—on a party-line vote of 60–39.  [311] On March 21, 2010, the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212.  [312] Obama signed the bill into law on March 23, 2010.  [313]\n The ACA includes  health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding  Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133% of the  federal poverty level (FPL) starting in 2014,  [314] subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400% of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum \"out-of-pocket\" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,  [315]  [316] providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing  health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. According to White House and CBO figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.  [315]  [317]\n\n         Percentage of Individuals in the United States without Health Insurance, 1963–2015 (Source:  JAMA)  [318]\n The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income  brackets, taxes on  indoor tanning, cuts to the  Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;  [319] there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.  [320] In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143 billion over the first decade.  [321]\n The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in   National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the U.S. Congress's taxing authority.  [322] In   Burwell v. Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that \"closely-held\" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in   King v. Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans \"established by the State,\" as the statute reads.  [323]\n\n  Energy policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Energy policy of the Obama administration\n Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based \"All of the above\" approach to domestic  energy policy, which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his  State of the Union speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.  [324] Obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.  [325]  [326]\n\n  Gun control  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Social policy of the Barack Obama administration § Gun policy\n         Obama visits an  Aurora shooting victim at  University of Colorado Hospital, 2012.\n On January 16, 2013, one month after the  Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding  gun control.  [327] He urged Congress to reintroduce an  expired ban on military-style  assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for the first time since 2006.  [328] On January 5, 2016, Obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers.  [329] In a 2016 editorial in the  New York Times, Obama compared the struggle for what he termed \"common-sense gun reform\" to  women's suffrage and other  civil rights movements in American history.  [330]\n\n  2010 midterm elections  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  2010 United States House of Representatives elections and  2010 United States Senate elections\n Obama called the  November 2, 2010 election, where the Democratic Party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the House of Representatives,  [331] \"humbling\" and a \"shellacking.\"  [332] He said that the results came because not enough Americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.  [333]\n\n  Cybersecurity and Internet policy  [ edit ]\n On November 10, 2014, President Obama recommended the  Federal Communications Commission reclassify  broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve  net neutrality.  [334]  [335] On February 12, 2013, President Obama signed  Executive Order  13636, \"Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.\"  [336]\n\n  Government mass surveillance  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Barack Obama on mass surveillance\n In 2005 and 2006, Obama criticized certain aspects of the  Patriot Act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as Senator to strengthen civil liberties protections.  [337]  [338]  [339] In 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the Patriot Act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties.  [339] In 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the Patriot Act.  [340] Following the  2013 global surveillance disclosures by  whistleblower  Edward Snowden, Obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic,  [338] but called for increased restrictions on the NSA to address violations of privacy.  [341]  [342] The changes which Obama ordered have been described as \"modest\" however.  [343]\n\n  Foreign policy  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration\n         June 4, 2009 − after his speech   A New Beginning at  Cairo University, U.S. President Obama participates in a roundtable interview in 2009 with among others  Jamal Khashoggi,  Bambang Harymurti and  Nahum Barnea.\n In February and March 2009, Vice President Joe Biden and  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a \"new era\" in U.S. foreign relations with Russia and Europe, using the terms \"break\" and \" reset\" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration.  [344] Obama attempted to reach out to Arab leaders by granting his first interview to an Arab satellite TV network,  Al Arabiya.  [345]\n On March 19, Obama continued his outreach to the Muslim world, releasing a New Year's video message to the people and government of Iran.  [346]  [347] In April, Obama gave a speech in  Ankara, Turkey, which was well received by many Arab governments.  [348] On June 4, 2009, Obama delivered a speech at  Cairo University in Egypt calling for \" A New Beginning\" in relations between the Islamic world and the United States and promoting Middle East peace.  [349]\n\n          International trips made by President Barack Obama during his terms in office\n         Obama with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel in 2011\n On June 26, 2009, Obama responded to the Iranian government's actions towards protesters following  Iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: \"The violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. We see it and we condemn it.\"  [350] While in Moscow on July 7, he responded to Vice President Biden's comment on a possible Israeli military strike on Iran by saying: \"We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East.\"  [351]\n On September 24, 2009, Obama became the first sitting U.S. President to  preside over a meeting of the  United Nations Security Council.  [352]\n In March 2010, Obama took a public stance against plans by the government of Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu to continue building Jewish housing projects in predominantly Arab neighborhoods of  East Jerusalem.  [353]  [354] During the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev to replace the  1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.  [355] Obama and Medvedev signed the  New START treaty in April 2010, and the  U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.  [356]\n\n         Obama meets with Italian Prime Minister  Matteo Renzi at the  White House, October 2016.\n In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider  LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.  [357] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,  [358] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming  2014 Winter Olympics in  Sochi, Russia.  [359]\n In December 2014, Obama announced that he intended to  normalize relationships between  Cuba and the United States.  [360] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20, 2015.\n In March 2015, Obama declared that he had authorized U.S. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the Saudis in their  military intervention in Yemen, establishing a \"Joint Planning Cell\" with Saudi Arabia.  [361]  [362] In 2016, the Obama administration proposed a series of  arms deals with Saudi Arabia worth $115 billion.  [363] Obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to  Saudi Arabia after Saudi warplanes  targeted a funeral in Yemen's capital Sanaa, killing more than 140 people.  [364]\n Before leaving office, Obama said German Chancellor  Angela Merkel had been his \"closest international partner\" throughout his tenure as president.  [365]\n\n  War in Iraq  [ edit ]\n Main articles:  Iraq War and  American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)\n On February 27, 2009, Obama announced that combat operations in Iraq would end within 18 months. His remarks were made to a group of  Marines preparing for deployment to Afghanistan. Obama said, \"Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\"  [366] The Obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by August 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in Iraq until the end of 2011. On August 19, 2010, the last U.S. combat brigade exited Iraq. Remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to  counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi security forces.  [367]  [368] On August 31, 2010, Obama announced that the United States combat mission in Iraq was over.  [369] On October 21, 2011 President Obama announced that all U.S. troops would leave Iraq in time to be \"home for the holidays.\"  [370]\n\n         Meeting with UK Prime Minister  David Cameron during the  2010 G20 Toronto summit\n In June 2014, following the  capture of Mosul by  ISIS, Obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for U.S. personnel and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. ISIS continued to gain ground and to commit  widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.  [371]  [372]\n In August 2014, during the  Sinjar massacre, Obama ordered a  campaign of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.  [373]\n By the end of 2014, 3,100 American ground troops were committed to the conflict  [374] and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.  [375]\n In early 2015, with the addition of the \"Panther Brigade\" of the  82nd Airborne Division the number of U.S. ground troops in Iraq surged to 4,400,  [376] and by July American-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.  [377]\n\n  War in Afghanistan  [ edit ]\n Main article:  War in Afghanistan (2001–present)\n Early in his presidency, Obama moved to bolster U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan.  [378] He announced an increase in U.S. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in February 2009 to \"stabilize a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan,\" an area he said had not received the \"strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires.\"  [379] He replaced the military commander in Afghanistan, General  David D. McKiernan, with former  Special Forces commander Lt. Gen.  Stanley A. McChrystal in May 2009, indicating that McChrystal's Special Forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war.  [380] On December 1, 2009, Obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to Afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date;  [381] this took place in July 2011.  David Petraeus replaced McChrystal in June 2010, after McChrystal's staff criticized White House personnel in a magazine article.  [382] In February 2013, Obama said the U.S. military would reduce the troop level in Afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 U.S. troops by February 2014.  [383]\n In October 2015, the White House announced a plan to keep U.S. Forces in Afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.  [384]\n\n  Israel  [ edit ]\n         Obama meeting with Israeli President  Shimon Peres in the  Oval Office, May 2009\n In 2011, the United States vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning  Israeli settlements, with the United States being the only nation to do so.  [385] Obama supports the  two-state solution to the  Arab–Israeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.  [386]\n In June 2011, Obama said the bond between the United States and Israel is \"unbreakable.\"  [387] During the initial years of the Obama administration, the U.S. increased military cooperation with Israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the  U.S.-Israeli Joint Political Military Group and the Defense Policy Advisory Group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries.  [388] The Obama administration asked Congress to allocate money toward funding the  Iron Dome program in response to the waves of  Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel.  [389]\n In 2013,  Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"  [390] In 2014, Obama likened the  Zionist movement to the  Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. He explained, \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"  [391] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the  2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.  [392] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the  Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"  [393]\n On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from  United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned  Israeli settlement building in the occupied  Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.  [394] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama Administration's actions,  [395]  [396] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.  [397] On January 5, 2017, the  United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.  [398]  [399]\n\n  Libya  [ edit ]\n Main article:  2011 military intervention in Libya\n         President Obama meets with Russian President  Vladimir Putin to discuss Syria and ISIS, September 29, 2015.\n In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator  Muammar Gaddafi as part of the  Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the  Arab League, and a resolution  [400] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.  [401] In response to the unanimous passage of  United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi  [402]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities,  [403] yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling  Misrata. The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,  [404] including the use of  Tomahawk missiles,  B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.  [405]  [406]  [407] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members,  NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed  Operation Unified Protector.  [408] Some Representatives  [409] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.  [410]  [411]\n\n  Syrian Civil War  [ edit ]\n See also:  Foreign involvement in the Syrian Civil War § United States\n On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the  Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for  President Assad to step aside.\"  [412]  [413] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.  [414] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple  programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.  [415] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.  [416]  [417]\n In the wake of a  chemical weapons attack in Syria,  formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged  [418] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad  giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with  chlorine gas continued.  [419]  [420] In 2014, Obama authorized an  air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL, but repeatedly promised the U.S. would not deploy ground troops in Syria.  [421]  [422]\n\n  Death of Osama bin Laden  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Death of Osama bin Laden\n       Play media     President Obama's address (9:28)   Also available:  Audio only;  Full text   \n         Obama and members of the national security team receive an update on  Operation Neptune's Spear in the  White House Situation Room, May 1, 2011. See also:   Situation Room\n Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of  Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in  a large compound in  Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from  Islamabad.  [423] CIA head  Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.  [423] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a \"surgical raid\" to be conducted by  United States Navy SEALs.  [423] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.  [424]  [425] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,  [426] which was buried at sea several hours later.  [427] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's  Ground Zero and  Times Square.  [424]  [428]  Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.  [429]\n\n \n  Iran nuclear talks  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n         Obama talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, March 2013.\n In November 2013, the Obama administration opened  negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring  nuclear weapons, which included an  interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced July 14, 2015. The deal, titled the \" Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\" saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli prime minister  Benjamin Netanyahu.  [430]  [431]  [432] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"  [433] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded  Hezbollah from the  Drug Enforcement Administration's  Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the  Central Intelligence Agency.  [434]  [435]\n\n  Relations with Cuba  [ edit ]\n Main article:  United States–Cuban Thaw\n         President Obama meeting with Cuban President  Raúl Castro in Panama, April 2015\n Since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the United States and Cuba in the neutral locations of Canada and  Vatican City.  [436] The Vatican first became involved in 2013 when  Pope Francis advised the U.S. and Cuba to  exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill.  [437] On December 10, 2013, Cuban President  Raúl Castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with Obama at the  Nelson Mandela memorial service in  Johannesburg.  [438]\n In December 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that Obama, with  Pope Francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with Cuba, after nearly sixty years of détente.  [439] Popularly dubbed the  Cuban Thaw,   The New Republic deemed the Cuban Thaw to be \"Obama's finest foreign policy achievement.\"  [440] On July 1, 2015, President Barack Obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States would resume, and embassies would be opened in Washington and  Havana.  [441] The countries' respective \"interests sections\" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on July 20 and August 13, 2015, respectively.  [442]\n Obama visited Havana, Cuba for two days in March 2016, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to arrive since  Calvin Coolidge in 1928.  [443]\n\n  Africa  [ edit ]\n Obama spoke in front of the  African Union in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on July 29, 2015, the first sitting U.S. president to do so. He gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in  education, infrastructure, and  economy. He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities ( LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified  democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for Africans.  [444]  [445] During his July 2015 trip, Obama also was the first U.S. president ever to  visit Kenya, which is the homeland of his father.  [446]\n\n  Hiroshima speech  [ edit ]\n On May 27, 2016, Obama became the first sitting American president to visit  Hiroshima, Japan, 71 years after the  U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima that ended  World War II. Accompanied by Japanese Prime Minister  Shinzō Abe, Obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the  Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.  [447]\n\n  Russia  [ edit ]\n See also:  Russia–United States relations § Obama's tenure (2009–17)\n         Obama meets Russian President  Vladimir Putin in September 2015.\n After  Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014,  military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the  interference in the  2016 U.S. presidential election,  [448] Obama's Russia policy was widely seen as a failure.  [449]  George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West,\" adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.  [450]\n\n  Cultural and political image  [ edit ]\n Main article:  Public image of Barack Obama\n See also:  International reactions to the 2008 United States presidential election and  International reactions to the 2012 United States presidential election\n Obama's family history, upbringing, and  Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the  civil rights movement.  [451] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough,\" Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the  National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"  [452] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"  [453]\n Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.  [454] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.  [455] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,  [456]  [457] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.  [458]\n\n         Presidential approval ratings\n According to the  Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating  [459] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010,  [460] a trend similar to  Ronald Reagan's and  Bill Clinton's first years in office.  [461] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the  death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.  [462]  [463] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration.  [464] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.  [465]\n Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.  [466]  [467] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by  Harris Interactive for  France 24 and the   International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.  [468] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.  [469]  [470]\n\n         G8 leaders watching the  2012 UEFA Champions League Final\n Obama won  Best Spoken Word Album  Grammy Awards for abridged  audiobook versions of   Dreams from My Father in February 2006 and for   The Audacity of Hope in February 2008.  [471] His  concession speech after the New Hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video \" Yes We Can,\" which was viewed 10 million times on YouTube in its first month  [472] and received a  Daytime Emmy Award.  [473] In December 2008 and in 2012,   Time magazine named Obama as its  Person of the Year.  [474] The 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which  Time described as \"the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments.\"  [475] On May 25, 2011, Obama became the first President of the United States to address both houses of the  UK Parliament in  Westminster Hall, London. This was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following  Charles de Gaulle in 1960,  Nelson Mandela in 1996,  Queen Elizabeth II in 2002 and  Pope Benedict XVI in 2010.  [476]  [477]\n On October 9, 2009, the  Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the  2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.\"  [478] Obama accepted this award in  Oslo, Norway on December 10, 2009, with \"deep gratitude and great humility.\"  [479] The award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.  [480]  [481]  [482]  [483] Obama's peace prize was called a \"stunning surprise\" by   The New York Times.  [484] Obama is the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.  [485] Obama's Nobel Prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the Nobel Institute,  Geir Lundestad, said Obama's Peace Prize did not have the desired effect.  [486]\n\n   Post-presidency (2017–present)  [ edit ]\n         Obama, with  Joe Biden and  Donald Trump at the latter's  inauguration on January 20, 2017\n Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the  inauguration of his Republican successor,  Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on  Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to  Joint Base Andrews.  [487] The family currently rents a house in  Kalorama, Washington, D.C.  [488]\n On March 2, 2017, the  John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual  Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"  [489] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the  University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.  [490] On May 4, three days ahead of the  French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed  Emmanuel Macron: \"He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France.\"  [491] Macron went on to win the election.\n While in  Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor  Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, Obama having been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.  [492] Obama traveled to  Kensington Palace in England and met with  Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the  Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.  [493]\n After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the  Paris Agreement on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: \"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.\"  [494]\n\n         Obama playing golf with the President of Argentina  Mauricio Macri, October 2017\n After Senate Republicans revealed the  Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the Affordable Care Act, on June 22, Obama released a Facebook post calling the bill \"a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\"  [495] On September 19, while delivering the keynote address at Goalkeepers, Obama admitted his frustration with Republicans backing \"a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older Americans and people with pre-existing conditions.\"  [496]\n After Attorney General  Jeff Sessions announced the termination of the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program on September 5, Obama released a Facebook post criticizing the decision.  [497] Two days later, he partnered with former presidents  Jimmy Carter,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush to work with  One America Appeal to help the victims of  Hurricane Harvey and  Hurricane Irma in the  Gulf Coast and  Texas communities.  [498]\n Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the  Obama Foundation in Chicago on October 31. Obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.  [499] Obama has also been working on a Presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with  Penguin Random House.  [500]\n Obama went on an international trip from November 28 to December 2, 2017, and visited China, India and France. In China, he delivered remarks at the Global Alliance of SMEs Summit in Shanghai and met with Chinese President  Xi Jinping in Beijing.  [501]  [502] He then went to India, where he spoke at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit before meeting with Indian Prime Minister  Narendra Modi over lunch. In addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the Obama Foundation.  [503]  [504] He also met with the  Dalai Lama while in New Delhi.  [505] He ended his five-day trip in France where he met with French President  Emmanuel Macron, former President  Francois Hollande and Paris Mayor  Anne Hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.  [506]\n Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for  Netflix under the Obamas’ newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions. On the deal, Michelle said \"I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"  [507]  [508] Higher Ground's first film,   American Factory, won the  Best Documentary Oscar in 2020.  [509]\n A package that contained a  pipe bomb was sent to Obama's home in Washington, D.C, on October 24, 2018. The package was intercepted by the Secret Service during routine mail screenings. Similar packages were sent to several other Democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of  Donald Trump and to  CNN.  Debbie Wasserman Schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. On October 26, 2018,  Cesar Sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in Manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.  [510]  [511]\n In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on  Martha's Vineyard from  Wyc Grousbeck.  [512]  [513]\n\n  Legacy  [ edit ]\n         Job growth during the presidency of Obama compared to predecessors, as measured as cumulative percentage change from month after inauguration to end of his term\n Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a \"skinny repeal,\" have thus far failed.  [514] Together with the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the  U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of  Medicare and  Medicaid in 1965.  [515]  [516]  [517]  [518]\n Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened  depression and pulling the economy back from the  Great Recession.  [514] According to the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the  Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after  his first inauguration to the end of his term.  [519] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the  Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the  financial crisis of 2007–08, it brought the most significant changes to  financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the  Great Depression under Democratic President  Franklin D. Roosevelt.  [520]\n In 2009, Obama signed into law the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President  Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded  existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.\n As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.  [521] In 2010, he signed the  Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \" don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from  LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.  [522] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on  transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.  [523]  [234] A  Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68% of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during Obama's eight years in office.  [524]\n Obama substantially escalated the use of  drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with  al-Qaeda and the  Taliban.  [525]  [526] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the US dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.  [527]  [528] Obama left about 8,400 US troops in  Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.  [529]  [530]\n According to  Pew Research Center and  United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in US federal custody since Democratic President  Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents  Ronald Reagan,  George H. W. Bush,  Bill Clinton, and  George W. Bush.  [531]\n Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating.  [532]  [533] A 2018 survey of historians by the  American Political Science Association ranked Obama the  8th-greatest American President.  [4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the  Brookings Institution that ranked Obama the 18th-greatest American President.
